129	0	How to export data from SQL Server 2005 to MySQL <p>I've been banging my head against <code>SQL Server 2005</code> trying to get a lot of data out. I've been given a database with nearly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database. My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn't produce valid CSV - strings aren't encapsulated, so you can't deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements, as obviously CSV doesn't tell you anything about the data types.</p> <p>What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL, then do a copy. You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc, but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it?</p> <p>Does anybody know of such a tool? I don't mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string. I have to do a lot of pruning, normalising, etc. anyway so I don't care about keeping keys, relationships or anything like that, but I need the initial set of data in fast!</p>

Something is not correct about the dimensions of what <code>rect.hclust()</code> generates, and I don't know how it works, to be able to write my own version.</p> <p>I appreciate any advice for getting <code>edgePar</code> or <code>rect.hclust()</code> to work properly, or to be able to write my own <code>rect.hclust()</code> equivalent.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p> <p>Since asking this question, I used <code>getAnywhere(rect.hclust())</code> to get the functional code that calculates parameters and draws the <code>rect</code> object. I wrote a custom version of this function to handle horizontal and vertical leaves, and call it with <code>dendrapply()</code>.</p> <p>However, there is some kind of clipping effect that removes part of the <code>rect</code>. For horizontal leaves (leaves that are drawn on the right side of the tree), the rightmost edge of the <code>rect</code> either disappears or is thinner than the border width of the other three sides of the <code>rect</code>. For vertical leaves (leaves that are drawn on the bottom of the tree), the bottommost edge of the <code>rect</code> suffers the same display problem.</p> <p>What I had done as a means of marking significant clusters is to reduce the width of the <code>rect</code> such that I render a vertical red stripe between the tips of the cluster edges and the (horizontal) leaf labels. </p> <p>This eliminates the clipping issue, but introduces another problem, in that the space between the cluster edge tips and the leaf labels is only six or so pixels wide, which I don't have much control over. This limits the width of the vertical stripe. </p> <p>The worse problem is that the <code>x</code>-coordinate that marks where the vertical stripe can fit between the two elements will change based on the width of the larger tree (<code>par["usr"]</code>), which in turn depends on how the tree hierarchy ends up being structured.</p> <p>I wrote a "correction" or, better termed, a hack to adjust this <code>x</code> value and the <code>rect</code> width for horizontal trees. It doesn't always work consistently, but for the trees I am making, it seems to keep from getting too close to (or overlapping) edges and labels.</p> <p>Ultimately, a better fix would be to find out how to draw the <code>rect</code> so that there is no clipping. Or a consistent way to calculate the specific <code>x</code> position in between tree edges and labels for any given tree, so as to center and size the stripe properly.</p> <p>I would also be very interested in a method for annotating edges with colors or line styles.</p>

1145	0	Why am I getting a double free or corruption error with realloc()? <p>I've tried to write a string replace function in C, which works on a <code>char *</code>, which has been allocated using <code>malloc()</code>. It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.</p> <p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated. If I try to use <code>realloc()</code>, I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using <code>realloc()</code>.</p> <p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p> <pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) { int searchLen = strlen(search); int replaceLen = strlen(replace); int delta = replaceLen - searchLen; char *find = input; while (find = strstr(find, search)) { if (delta &gt; 0) { realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta); find = strstr(input, search); } memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input)); memmove(find, replace, replaceLen); } } </code></pre> <p>The program works, until I try to <code>realloc()</code> in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string. (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p> <p>If it helps, the calling code looks like:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace); int main(void) { char *input = malloc(81); while ((fgets(input, 81, stdin)) != NULL) { strrep(input, "Noel", "Christmas"); } } </code></pre>

2043	0	Can a Windows dll retrieve its own filename? <p>A Windows process created from an exe file has access to the command string which invoked it, including its file's path and filename. eg. <code>C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe --help</code>.</p> <p>But this is not so for a dll invoked via <code>LoadLibrary</code>.

2872	0	Possible to "spin off" several GUI threads? (Not halting the system at Application.Run) <p><strong>My Goal</strong></p> <p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p> <p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <code>IComponent</code> interface with a single method <code>DoStuff()</code>.</p> <p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <code>IComponent</code>. The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p> <p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p> <ol> <li>Application starts.</li> <li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li> <li><strong>For each component, run <code>DoStuff()</code> to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li> <li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li> </ol> <p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code>. It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p> <p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p> <p><strong>Problem</strong></p> <p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code> (the exact line of code is when the component runs <code>Application.Run(theForm)</code>), the component and hence our system "hangs" at the <code>Application.Run()</code> line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p> <p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p> <pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent { public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database } } public class MyComponent2: IComponent { public void DoStuff() { Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); Application.Run(new Form()); // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work. } } </code></pre> <p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p> <pre><code>public void DoStuff() { new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start() } private void ThreadedInitialize() { Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); Application.Run(new Form()); } </code></pre> <p>Is it possible to spin off a GUI and return after <code>Application.Run()</code>?</p>

3437	0	Options for Google Maps over SSL <p>We recently discovered that the Google Maps API does not play nicely with SSL.

4582	0	Video Compression: What is discrete cosine transform? <p>I've implemented an image/video transformation technique called discrete cosine transform. This technique is used in MPEG video encoding. I based my algorithm on the ideas presented at the following URL:</p> <p><a href="http://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/~jan/MPEG/HTML/mpeg_tech.html" rel="noreferrer"><a href="http://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/~jan/MPEG/HTML/mpeg_tech.html" rel="noreferrer">http://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/~jan/MPEG/HTML/mpeg_tech.html</a></a></p> <p>Now I can transform an 8x8 section of a black and white image, such as:</p> <pre> 0140 0124 0124 0132 0130 0139 0102 0088 0140 0123 0126 0132 0134 0134 0088 0117 0143 0126 0126 0133 0134 0138 0081 0082 0148 0126 0128 0136 0137 0134 0079 0130 0147 0128 0126 0137 0138 0145 0132 0144 0147 0131 0123 0138 0137 0140 0145 0137 0142 0135 0122 0137 0140 0138 0143 0112 0140 0138 0125 0137 0140 0140 0148 0143 </pre> <p>Into this an image with all the important information at the top right. The transformed block looks like this:</p> <pre> 1041 0039 -023 0044 0027 0000 0021 -019 -050 0044 -029 0000 0009 -014 0032 -010 0000 0000 0000 0000 -018 0010 -017 0000 0014 -019 0010 0000 0000 0016 -012 0000 0010 -010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 -016 0021 -014 0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 -010 0013 -014 0010 0000 0000 </pre> <p>Now, I need to know how can I take advantage of this transformation? I'd like to detect other 8x8 blocks in the same image ( or another image ) that represent a good match.</p> <p>Also, What does this transformation give me?

1401904	1	Painless way to install a new version of R? <p><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/08/upgrading_r.html" rel="noreferrer">Andrew Gelman recently lamented the lack of an easy upgrade process for R</a> (probably more relevant on Windows than Linux). Does anyone have a good trick for doing the upgrade, from installing the software to copying all the settings/packages over?</p> <p>This suggestion was contained in the comments and is what I've been using recently. First you install the new version, then run this in the old verion:</p> <pre><code>#--run in the old version of R setwd("C:/Temp/") packages &lt;- installed.packages()[,"Package"] save(packages, file="Rpackages") </code></pre> <p>Followed by this in the new version:</p> <pre><code>#--run in the new version setwd("C:/Temp/") load("Rpackages") for (p in setdiff(packages, installed.packages()[,"Package"])) install.packages(p) </code></pre>
4880	0	Is a "Confirm Email" input good practice when user changes email address? <p>My organization has a form to allow users to update their email address with us. It's suggested that we have two input boxes for email: the second as an email confirmation.</p> <p>I always copy/paste my email address when faced with the confirmation. I'm assuming most of our users are not so savvy.</p> <p>Regardless, is this considered a good practice? I can't stand it personally, but I also realize it probably isn't meant for me. If someone screws up their email, they can't login, and they must call to sort things out.</p>
4884	0	How to keyboard down or up between dropdown "options"? <p>I have a custom built ajax [div] based dynamic dropdown. </p> <p>I have an [input] box which; <code>onkeyup</code>, runs an Ajax search which returns results in <code>div</code>s and are drawn back in using <code>innerHTML</code>. These <code>div</code>s all have highlights <code>onmouseover</code> so, a typical successful search yields the following structure (pardon the semi-code):</p> <pre><code>[input] [div id=results] //this gets overwritten contantly by my AJAX function [div id=result1 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result1] [div id=result2 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result2] [div id=result2 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result2] [/div] </code></pre> <p>It works.</p> <p>However, I'm missing the important functions behind regular HTML elements.

1407647	1	Reading text files using read.table <p>I have a text file with an <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> column, and I'm trying to read it into a data frame in R:</p> <pre><code>d = read.table("foobar.txt", sep="\t") </code></pre> <p>But for some reason, a lot of lines get merged -- e.g., in row 500 of my data frame, I'll see something like</p> <pre><code>row 500: 500 Bob\n501\tChris\n502\tGrace </code></pre> <p>[So if my original text file has, say, 5000 lines, the dimensions of my table will only end up being 1000 rows and 2 columns.]</p> <p>I've had this happen to me quite a few times.

4973	0	Setting a div's height in HTML with CSS <p>I am trying to lay out a table-like page with two columns. I want the rightmost column to dock to the right of the page, and this column should have a distinct background color.

5260	0	What is the best way to wrap time around the work day? <p>I have a situation where I want to add hours to a date and have the new date wrap around the work-day. I cobbled up a function to determine this new date, but want to make sure that I'm not forgetting anything.</p> <p>The hours to be added is called "delay". It could easily be a parameter to the function instead.</p> <p>Please post any suggestions. [VB.NET Warning]</p> <pre><code>Private Function GetDateRequired() As Date ''// A decimal representation of the current hour Dim hours As Decimal = Decimal.Parse(Date.Now.Hour) + (Decimal.Parse(Date.Now.Minute) / 60.0) Dim delay As Decimal = 3.0 ''// delay in hours Dim endOfDay As Decimal = 12.0 + 5.0 ''// end of day, in hours Dim startOfDay As Decimal = 8.0 ''// start of day, in hours Dim newHour As Integer Dim newMinute As Integer Dim dateRequired As Date = Now Dim delta As Decimal = hours + delay ''// Wrap around to the next day, if necessary If delta &gt; endOfDay Then delta = delta - endOfDay dateRequired = dateRequired.AddDays(1) newHour = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate(delta)) newMinute = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate((delta - newHour) * 60)) newHour = startOfDay + newHour Else newHour = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate(delta)) newMinute = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate((delta - newHour) * 60)) End If dateRequired = New Date(dateRequired.Year, dateRequired.Month, dateRequired.Day, newHour, newMinute, 0) Return dateRequired End Sub </code></pre> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This will probably not work if delay is more than 9 hours long. It should never change from 3, through.</p> <p>EDIT: The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>

Found that there's a WebForms tab that shows the values in the web form. Wouldn't you know it, the "<code>xxx_DISPLAYED_</code>" fields above were in it. </p> <p>I don't really understand yet why these fields exist, because I didn't create them explicitly in the web <code>PLSQL</code> code. But I do understand now that the target procedure has to include them as parameters to work correctly. Again, this is only in the case of <code>IE6</code> for me, as Firefox worked fine.</p> <p>Well, that the short term answer and hack to fix it. Hopefully, a little more work in this area will lead to a better understanding of the fundamentals going on here. </p>

6392	0	Java Time Zone is messed up <p>I am running a Tomcat application, and I need to display some time values. Unfortunately, the time is coming up an hour off. I looked into it and discovered that my default TimeZone is being set to:</p> <pre><code>sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id="GMT-08:00", offset=-28800000, dstSavings=0, useDaylight=false, transitions=0, lastRule=null] </code></pre> <p>Rather than the Pacific time zone. This is further indicated when I try to print the default time zone's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getDisplayName()" rel="noreferrer">display name</a>, and it comes up "GMT-08:00", which seems to indicate to me that it is not correctly set to the US Pacific time zone. I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.</p> <p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information? The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p> <hr> <p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include "-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p> <p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p> <hr> <p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem. As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings. My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone. Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up? I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>

Is it possible to do this without using Flash or is this the only real solution? I would like to keep it as cross-platform and standard as possible.</p>
7237	0	Does running a SQL Server 2005 database in compatibility level 80 have a negative impact on performance? <p>Our software must be able to run on SQL Server 2000 and 2005. To simplify development, we're running our SQL Server 2005 databases in compatibility level 80. However, database performance seems slower on SQL 2005 than on SQL 2000 in some cases (we have not confirmed this using benchmarks yet). Would upgrading the compatibility level to 90 improve performance on the SQL 2005 servers?</p>
7277	0	Is it "bad practice" to be sensitive to linebreaks in XML documents? <p>I'm generating some XML documents and when it comes to the address part I have fragments that look like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;Address&gt;15 Sample St Example Bay Some Country&lt;/Address&gt; </code></pre> <p>The XSLT that I have for converting this to XHTML has some funky recursive template to convert newline characters within strings to &lt;br/&gt; tags.</p> <p>This is all working fine; but is it considered "bad practice" to rely on linebreaks within XML documents?

7367	0	Visual Studio - new "default" property values for inherited controls <p>I'm looking for help setting a new default property value for an inherited control in Visual Studio:</p> <pre><code>class NewCombo : System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox { public NewCombo() { DropDownItems = 50; } } </code></pre> <p>The problem is that the base class property <code>DropDownItems</code> has a 'default' attribute set on it that is a different value (not 50). As a result, when I drag the control onto a form, the designer file gets an explicit <code>mycontrol.DropDownItems = 50;</code> line.</p> <p>At first, this doesn't matter. But if later I change my inherited class to <code>DropDownItems = 45;</code> in the constructor, this does not affect any of the controls on any form since all those designer files still have the value 50 hard-coded in them. And the whole point was to have the value set in one place so I can deal with the customer changing his mind.</p> <p>Obviously, if I were creating my own custom property in the subclass, I could give it its own designer default attribute of whatever I wanted. But here I'm wanting to change the default values of properties in the base. Is there any way to apply Visual Studio attributes to a base class member? Or is there some other workaround to get the result I want?</p>

Currently it appears like this</p> <blockquote> <p>Rendered in 0.062 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>Occasionally I get rendered times like this</p> <blockquote> <p>Rendered in 0.000 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>Currently it's only meant to be a guide for users to judge whether a page is quick to load or not, allowing them to quickly inform us if a page is taking 17 seconds rather than the usual 0.5. My question is what format should the time be in? At which point should I switch to a statement such as</p> <blockquote> <p>Rendered in less than a second</p> </blockquote> <p>I like seeing the tenths of a second but the second example above is of no use to anyone, in fact it just highlights the limits of the calculation I use to find the render time.

8742	0	Getting accurate ticks from a timer in C# <p>I'm trying to rebuild an old metronome application that was originally written using MFC in C++ to be written in .NET using C#. One of the issues I'm running into is getting the timer to "tick" accurately enough.</p> <p>For example, assuming an easy BPM (beats per minute) of 120, the timer should tick every .5 seconds (or 500 milliseconds). Using this as the basis for the ticks, however, isn't entirely accurate as .NET only guarantees that your timer will not tick before the elapsed time has passed.</p> <p>Currently, to get around this for the same 120 BPM example used above, I am setting the ticks to something like 100 milliseconds and only playing the click sound on every 5th timer tick. This does improve the accuracy quite a bit, but if feels like a bit of a hack.</p> <p>So, what is the best way to get accurate ticks? I know there are more timers available than the windows forms timer that is readily available in Visual Studio, but I'm not really familiar with them.</p>

10006	0	What is the easiest way to add compression to WCF in Silverlight? <p>I have a silverlight 2 beta 2 application that accesses a WCF web service. Because of this, it currently can only use basicHttp binding. The webservice will return fairly large amounts of XML data. This seems fairly wasteful from a bandwidth usage standpoint as the response, if zipped, would be smaller by a factor of 5 (I actually pasted the response into a txt file and zipped it.). </p> <p>The request does have the "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" - Is there any way have the WCF service gzip (or otherwise compress) the response?</p> <p>I did find this <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/indigo/113763-wcf-client-j2ee-server-using-gzip.html" rel="noreferrer">link</a> but it sure seems a bit complex for functionality that should be handled out-of-the-box IMHO.</p> <p>OK - at first I marked the solution using the System.IO.Compression as the answer as I could never "seem" to get the IIS7 dynamic compression to work. Well, as it turns out:</p> <ol> <li><p>Dynamic Compression on IIS7 <strong>was</strong> working al along. It is just that Nikhil's Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working. My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it "under the covers" and Nikhil's tool never sees the compressed response. I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application. In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressed!!</p></li> <li><p>The other problem with the System.IO.Compression solution is that System.IO.Compression does not exist in the Silverlight CLR.</p></li> </ol> <p>So from my perspective, the EASIEST way to enable WCF compression in Silverlight is to enable Dynamic Compression in IIS7 and write no code at all.</p>

10506	0	Weird DB2 issue with DBUnit <p>I am having a strange DB2 issue when I run DBUnit tests. My DBUnit tests are highly customized, but I don't think it is the issue. When I run the tests, I get a failure: </p> <blockquote> <p>SQLCODE: -1084, SQLSTATE: 57019</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/acis/db2/db2m0/sql1000.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">which translates to</a> </p> <blockquote> <p>SQL1084C Shared memory segments cannot be allocated.</p> </blockquote> <p>It sounds like a weird memory issue, though here's the big strange thing. If I ssh to the test database server, then go in to db2 and do "connect to MY_DB", the tests start succeeding! This seems to have no relation to the supposed memory error that is being reported.</p> <p>I have 2 tests, and the first one actually succeeds, the second one is the one that fails. However, it fails in the DBUnit setup code, when it is obtaining the connection to the DB server to load my xml dataset.</p> <p>Any ideas what might be going on?</p>

This helps with general living as well as programming.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Money is/can be pretty good.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Its a pretty portable trade..

Which can often reflect badly on all of us.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Not so sure about the initial cost.. Yeah you can get started with Java or something at low cost, but for me, locally, the vast demand is for .NET developers, which can be costly getting up and running with. However, this is rapidly/has not becoming the case with the amount of work put in by MS with releasing pretty damn good Express editions of their main development product line.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Its a lifelong career.. I truly feel you never really become a "master" by nature of the industry, you stop for 1-2 years. You're behind the times.. Some people do not like the pace.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Some geeks can be hard to work with..

When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell. Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.</p> <p>The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all. That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a: complex, and b: brittle.</p> <p>So I'm trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me I'm perhaps tackling it the wrong way. Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE: does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.</p> <p>Has anyone got any experiences of something similar to this they would care to share?</p>

11854	0	Inheritance and Polymorphism - Ease of use vs Purity <p>In a project our team is using object lists to perform mass operations on sets of data that should all be processed in a similar way. In particular, different objects would ideally act the same, which would be very easily achieved with polymorphism. The problem I have with it is that inheritance implies the <em>is a</em> relationship, rather than the <em>has a</em> relationship. For example, several objects <em>have a</em> damage counter, but to make this easy to use in an object list, polymorphism could be used - except that would imply an <em>is a</em> relationship which wouldn't be true. (A person <em>is not a</em> damage counter.)</p> <p>The only solution I can think of is to have a member of the class return the proper object type when implicitly casted instead of relying on inheritance. Would it be better to forgo the <em>is a</em> / <em>has a</em> ideal in exchange for ease of programming?</p> <p>Edit: To be more specific, I am using C++, so using polymorphism would allow the different objects to "act the same" in the sense that the derived classes could reside within a single list and be operated upon by a virtual function of the base class. The use of an interface (or imitating them via inheritance) seems like a solution I would be willing to use.</p>

13678	0	Textual versus Graphical Programming Languages <p>I am part of a high school robotics team, and there is some debate about which language to use to program our robot. We are choosing between C (or maybe C++) and LabVIEW. There are pros for each language.</p> <p>C(++):</p> <ul> <li>Widely used</li> <li>Good preparation for the future (most programming positions require text-based programmers.)</li> <li>We can expand upon our C codebase from last year</li> <li>Allows us to better understand what our robot is doing.</li> </ul> <p>LabVIEW</p> <ul> <li>Easier to visualize program flow (blocks and wires, instead of lines of code)</li> <li>Easier to teach (Supposedly...)</li> <li>"The future of programming is graphical." (Think so?)</li> <li>Closer to the Robolab background that some new members may have.</li> <li>Don't need to intimately know what's going on. Simply tell the module to find the red ball, don't need to know how.</li> </ul> <p>This is a very difficult decision for us, and we've been debating for a while. Based on those pros for each language, and on the experience you've got, <strong>what do you think the better option is?</strong> Keep in mind that we aren't necessarily going for pure efficiency. We also hope to prepare our programmers for a future in programming.</p> <p>Also:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Do you think that graphical languages such as LabVEIW are the future of programming?</strong></li> <li><strong>Is a graphical language easier to learn than a textual language?</strong> I think that they should be about equally challenging to learn.</li> <li>Seeing as we are partailly rooted in helping people learn, <strong>how much should we rely on prewritten modules, and how much should we try to write on our own?</strong> ("Good programmers write good code, great programmers copy great code." But isn't it worth being a good programmer, first?)</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for the advice!</p> <hr> <p>Edit: I'd like to emphasize this question more: The team captain thinks that LabVIEW is better for its ease of learning and teaching. <strong>Is that true?</strong> I think that C could be taught just as easily, and beginner-level tasks would still be around with C. I'd really like to hear your opinions. <strong>Is there any reason that typing while{} should be any more difficult than creating a "while box?"</strong> <strong>Isn't it just as intuitive that program flows line by line, only modified by ifs and loops, as it is intuitive that the program flows through the wire, only modified by ifs and loops!?</strong></p> <p>Thanks again!</p> <hr> <p>Edit: I just realized that this falls under the topic of "language debate." I hope it's okay, because it's about what's best for a specific branch of programming, with certain goals. If it's not... I'm sorry...</p>

You could think of the game engine as an OS and the game as a software the OS would run. The game could be a collection of scripts or an actual subroutine inside the game engine.</p> <p><strong>Possible Answers</strong></p> <p>My idea is this: </p> <p>You would need an engine that is deterministic. This means that given one set of input, the output would be exactly the same. This would inlude the random generator being seeded with the same input.</p> <p>Then, create a bare-bone level which contains a couple of objects the avatar/user can interact with. Start small and then add objects into the level as more interactions are developed.</p> <p>Create a script which follows a path (tests pathfinding) and interact with the different objects (store the result or expected behavior). This script would be your automated test. After a certain amount of time (say, one week), run the script along with your engine's unit tests.</p>

15163	0	Prevent a TreeView from firing events in VB6? <p>In some VB6 code, I have a handler for a TreeView's Collapse event:</p> <pre><code>Private Sub MyTree_Collapse(ByVal Node as MSComCtlLib.Node) </code></pre> <p>This is called whenever a node in the tree is collapsed, whether by the user or programmatically. As it turns out, through some roundabout execution, it may happen that this handler will wind up telling a node to collapse, leading to infinite recursion.</p> <p>I can think of multiple ways to skin this cat, but what seems simplest to me is to tell the TreeView not to raise events for some period of time. I can't find a simple call to let me do this, though. Has anyone successfully done this, or do I need to keep track of state in some other manner so I can respond appropriately when recursive events come along?</p>
2241290	1	Stacked Area Histogram in R <p>I ran a Pig job on a Hadoop cluster that crunched a bunch of data down into something R can handle to do a cohort analysis. I have the following script, and as of the second to last line I have the data in the format:</p> <pre><code>&gt; names(data) [1] "VisitWeek" "ThingAge" "MyMetric" </code></pre> <p>VisitWeek is a Date. ThingAge and MyMetric are integers.</p> <p>The data looks like:</p> <pre><code>2010-02-07 49 12345 </code></pre> <p>The script I have so far is:</p> <pre><code># Load ggplot2 for charting library(ggplot2); # Our file has headers - column names data = read.table('weekly_cohorts.tsv',header=TRUE,sep="\t"); # Print the names names(data) # Convert to dates data$VisitWeek = as.Date(data$VisitWeek) data$ThingCreation = as.Date(data$ThingCreation) # Fill in the age column data$ThingAge = as.integer(data$VisitWeek - data$ThingCreation) # Filter data to thing ages lt 10 weeks (70 days) + a sanity check for gt 0, and drop the creation week column data = subset(data, data$ThingAge &lt;= 70, c("VisitWeek","ThingAge","MyMetric")) data = subset(data, data$ThingAge &gt;= 0) print(ggplot(data, aes(x=VisitWeek, y=MyMetric, fill=ThingAge)) + geom_area()) </code></pre> <p>This last line does not work. I've tried lots of variations, bars, histograms, but as usual R docs defeat me.</p> <p>I want it to show a standard Excel style stacked area chart - one time series for each ThingAge stacked across the weeks in the x axis, with the date on the y axis. An example of this kind of chart is here: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Mk_Zuwanderer.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Mk_Zuwanderer.png</a></p> <p>I've read the docs here: <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_area.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_area.html</a> and <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_histogram.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_histogram.html</a> and this blog <a href="http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/r-lattice-plot-beats-excel-stacked-area-trend-chart/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/r-lattice-plot-beats-excel-stacked-area-trend-chart/</a> but I can't quite make it work for me.</p> <p>How can I achieve this?</p>
15254	0	Can placement new for arrays be used in a portable way? <p>Is it possible to actually make use of placement new in portable code when using it for arrays?</p> <p>It appears that the pointer you get back from new[] is not always the same as the address you pass in (5.3.4, note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct), but I don't see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case.</p> <p>The following example shows the problem. Compiled with Visual Studio, this example results in memory corruption:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; class A { public: A() : data(0) {} virtual ~A() {} int data; }; int main() { const int NUMELEMENTS=20; char *pBuffer = new char[NUMELEMENTS*sizeof(A)]; A *pA = new(pBuffer) A[NUMELEMENTS]; // With VC++, pA will be four bytes higher than pBuffer printf("Buffer address: %x, Array address: %x\n", pBuffer, pA); // Debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption delete[] pBuffer; return 0; } </code></pre> <p>Looking at the memory, the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it. This means that because the buffer is only <code>sizeof(A)*NUMELEMENTS</code> big, the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap.</p> <p>So the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new[] safely? Ideally, I need a technique that's portable between different compilers. Note that, at least in VC's case, the overhead seems to differ for different classes. For instance, if I remove the virtual destructor in the example, the address returned from new[] is the same as the address I pass in.</p>

15731	0	Looking for a specific FireFox extension / program for Form posting <p>I am looking for either a FireFox extension, or a similar program, that allows you to craft GET and POST requests. The user would put in a form action, and as many form key/value pairs as desired. It would also send any cookie information (or send the current cookies from any domain the user chooses.)

15805	0	Why are my auto-run applications acting weird on Vista? <p>The product we are working on allows the user to easily set it up to run automatically whenever the computer is started. This is helpful because the product is part of the basic work environment of most of our users.<br> This feature was implemented not so long ago and for a while all was well, but when we started testing this feature on Vista the product started behaving really weird on startup. Specifically, our product makes use of another product (lets call it X) that it launches whenever it needs its services. The actual problem is that whenever X is launched immediately after log-on, it crashes or reports critical errors related to disk access (this happens even when X is launched directly - not through our product).</p> <p>This happens whenever we run our product by registering it in the "Run" key in the registry or place a shortcut to it in the "<em>Startup</em>" folder inside the "<em>Start Menu</em>", even when we put a delay of ~20 seconds before actually starting to run. When we changed the delay to 70 seconds, all is well.</p> <p>We tried to reproduce the problem by launching our product manually immediately after logon (by double-clicking on a shortcut placed on the desktop) but to no avail.</p> <p>Now how is it possible that applications that run normally a minute after logon report such hard errors when starting immediately after logon?</p>

2293131	1	Reading in files with two rows for header <p>I have been using SurveyGizmo which can export data as a CSV file but alas it has two rows for header. The first row specifies the question and the second row contains possible responses that the respondent could have checked off. This seems highly aberrant in the data-read-and-write world but seems quite normal in the survey world. How does one read such a file into R?</p> <p>SurveyGizmo used to have an &quot;old&quot; export format put everything into one row but it seems that company is not supporting it anymore. In a simple survey an intern who was helping me was able to overcome the problem with the following code. However, with a longer survey with more questions and with the questions being longer (and thus the headers being longer) our brute force method above is not working.</p> <pre><code>#Read csv file with two rows of headers #Append the second row to the first row df &lt;-read.csv(csvfile,skip=1,stringsAsFactors=FALSE) #Read csv without any header hl=readLines(csvfile, 2) #Read the two header lines as char strings hl=strsplit(hl,',') #Split headers up by commas colnames(df)=sub('_$','',paste(hl[[1]],hl[[2]],sep=&quot;&quot;)) #join second row to first row </code></pre> <p>At the end I want a data frame with column headings which I will then merge with another data frame coming from a follow up survey.</p> <p>Here is an example of the CSV file with two header rows.

17299	0	How can I sort an array of double pointers based on the values they point to? <p>I am trying to build a function in C/C++ to sort an array and replace each value with its "score" or rank. It takes in a double pointer array to an array of ints, and sorts the double pointers based on the dereferenced value of the integers. I have tried quite a few times to make it work, but can't get it down. Once again, it must sort the double pointers based on the values they point to. This is what I have:</p> <pre><code>void SortArray( int ** pArray, int ArrayLength ) { int i, j, flag = 1; // set flag to 1 to begin initial pass int * temp; // holding variable orig with no * for(i = 1; (i &lt;= ArrayLength) &amp;&amp; flag; i++) { flag = 0; for (j = 0; j &lt; (ArrayLength -1); j++) { if (*pArray[j+1] &gt; *pArray[j]) // ascending order simply changes to &lt; { temp = &amp;pArray[j]; // swap elements pArray[j] = &amp;pArray[j+1]; pArray[j+1] = &amp;temp; flag = 1; // indicates that a swap occurred. } } } } </code></pre>

17717	0	Migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL <p>We are currently using MySQL for a product we are building, and are keen to move to PostgreSQL as soon as possible, primarily for licensing reasons.</p> <p>Has anyone else done such a move?

We are developing a commercial product which (currently) depends on MySQL as a database back-end. Their license states we need to pay them a percentage of our list price per installation, and not a flat fee. As a startup, this is less than appealing.</p>

18059	0	Prevent WebBrowser control from swallowing exceptions <p>I'm using the <code>System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser</code>, to make a view a-la Visual Studio Start Page. However, it seems the control is catching and handling all exceptions by silently sinking them! No need to tell this is a very unfortunate behaviour.</p> <pre><code>void webBrowserNavigating(object sender, WebBrowserNavigatingEventArgs e) { // WebBrowser.Navigating event handler throw new Exception("OMG!"); } </code></pre> <p>The code above will cancel navigation and swallow the exception.</p> <pre><code>void webBrowserNavigating(object sender, WebBrowserNavigatingEventArgs e) { // WebBrowser.Navigating event handler try { e.Cancel = true; if (actions.ContainsKey(e.Url.ToString())) { actions[e.Url.ToString()].Invoke(e.Url, webBrowser.Document); } } catch (Exception exception) { MessageBox.Show(exception.ToString()); } } </code></pre> <p>So, what I do (above) is catch all exceptions and pop a box, this is better than silently failing but still clearly far from ideal. I'd like it to redirect the exception through the normal application failure path so that it ultimately becomes unhandled, or handled by the application from the root.</p> <p>Is there any way to tell the <code>WebBrowser</code> control to stop sinking the exceptions and just forward them the natural and expected way? Or is there some hacky way to throw an exception through native boundaries?</p>

2486130	1	Programming R/Sweave for proper \Sexpr output <p>I'm having a bit of a problem programming R for Sweave, and the #rstats twitter group often points here, so I thought I'd put this question to the SO crowd. I'm an analyst- not a programmer- so go easy on my first post. </p> <p>Here's the problem: I am drafting a survey report in Sweave with R and would like to report the marginal returns in line using <code>\Sexpr{}</code>. For example, rather than saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>Only 14% of respondents said 'X'.</p> </blockquote> <p>I want to write the report like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Only \Sexpr{p.mean(variable)}$\%$ of respondents said 'X'. </p> </blockquote> <p>The problem is that Sweave converts the results of the expression in <code>\Sexpr{}</code> to a character string, which means that the output from the expression in R and the output that appears in my document are different. For example, above I use the function 'p.mean':</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>p.mean&lt;- function (x) {options(digits=1) mmm&lt;-weighted.mean(x, weight=weight, na.rm=T) print(100*mmm) } </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>In R, the output looks like this:</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>p.mean(variable) &gt;14 </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>but when I use <code>\Sexpr{p.mean(variable)}</code>, I get an unrounded character string (in this case: 13.5857142857143) in my document. I have tried to limit the output of my function to <code>digits=1</code> in the global environment, in the function itself, and and in various commands. It only seems to contain what R prints, not the character transformation that is the result of the expression and which eventually prints in the LaTeX file. </p> <blockquote> <pre><code>as.character(p.mean(variable)) &gt;[1] 14 &gt;[1] "13.5857142857143" </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>Does anyone know what I can do to limit the digits printed in the LaTeX file, either by reprogramming the R function or with a setting in Sweave or <code>\Sexpr{}</code>?</p>

Or a way to reference a user's home directory? </p> <p>Otherwise, I was thinking of trying this: </p> <pre><code>Sys.getenv("temp") </code></pre> <p>I presume that I can't expect people to have write access to their R locations, otherwise I could reference a path within the package directory: <code>.find.package("package.name")</code>.</p>

19963	0	What's the best way of diffing Crystal Reports? <p>If you have two versions of the same report (.rpt) and you want to establish what the exact differences are, what is the best way to go about this? I've seen some commercial tools to do this, but I'm not too interested in forking out cash for something that should be relatively straight forward. Can I hook into the Crystal API and simply list all of the properties of every field or something? Please someone tell me that there's an Open Source project somewhere that does this... @:-)</p> <p>@Kogus, wouldn't diffing the outputs as text hide any formatting differences?</p> <p>@ladoucep, I don't seem to be able to export the report <em>without</em> data.</p>
2531402	1	How can I superimpose modified loess lines on a ggplot2 qplot? <h3>Background</h3> <p>Right now, I'm creating a multiple-predictor linear model and generating diagnostic plots to assess regression assumptions. (It's for a multiple regression analysis stats class that I'm loving at the moment :-)</p> <p>My textbook (Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken 2003) recommends plotting each predictor against the residuals to make sure that:</p> <ol> <li>The residuals don't systematically covary with the predictor</li> <li>The residuals are homoscedastic with respect to each predictor in the model</li> </ol> <p>On point (2), my textbook has this to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>Some statistical packages allow the analyst to plot lowess fit lines at the mean of the residuals (0-line), 1 standard deviation above the mean, and 1 standard deviation below the mean of the residuals....In the present case {their example}, the two lines {mean + 1sd and mean - 1sd} remain roughly parallel to the lowess {0} line, consistent with the interpretation that the variance of the residuals does not change as a function of X. (p. 131)</p> </blockquote> <h3>How can I modify loess lines?</h3> <p>I know how to generate a scatterplot with a "0-line,":</p> <pre><code> # First, I'll make a simple linear model and get its diagnostic stats library(ggplot2) data(cars) mod &lt;- fortify(lm(speed ~ dist, data = cars)) attach(mod) str(mod) # Now I want to make sure the residuals are homoscedastic qplot (x = dist, y = .resid, data = mod) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) # "se = FALSE" Removes the standard error bands </code></pre> <p>But does anyone know how I can use <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>qplot</code> to generate plots where the 0-line, "mean + 1sd" AND "mean - 1sd" lines would be superimposed?

2545879	1	Row/column counter in 'apply' functions <p>What if one wants to <code>apply</code> a functon i.e. to each row of a matrix, but also wants to use as an argument for this function the number of that row. As an example, suppose you wanted to get the n-th root of the numbers in each row of a matrix, where n is the row number. Is there another way (using <code>apply</code> only) than column-binding the row numbers to the initial matrix, like this?</p> <pre><code>test &lt;- data.frame(x=c(26,21,20),y=c(34,29,28)) t(apply(cbind(as.numeric(rownames(test)),test),1,function(x) x[2:3]^(1/x[1]))) </code></pre> <p>P.S.

20321	0	One database or many? <p>I am developing a website that will manage data for multiple entities. No data is shared between entities, but they may be owned by the same customer. A customer may want to manage all their entities from a single "dashboard". So should I have one database for everything, or keep the data seperated into individual databases? Is there a best-practice? What are the positives/negatives for having a:</p> <ul> <li>database for the entire site (entity has a "customerID", data has "entityID")</li> <li>database for each customer (data has "entityID")</li> <li>database for each entity (relation of database to customer is outside of database)</li> </ul> <p>Multiple databases seems like it would have better performance (fewer rows and joins) but may eventually become a maintenance nightmare.</p>

20511	0	How do you unit test web apps hosted remotely? <p>I'm familiar with TDD and use it in both my workplace and my home-brewed web applications. However, every time I have used TDD in a web application, I have had the luxury of having full access to the web server. That means that I can update the server then run my unit tests directly from the server. My question is, if you are using a third party web host, how do you run your unit tests on them?</p> <p>You could argue that if your app is designed well and your build process is sound and automated, that running unit tests on your production server isn't necessary, but personally I like the peace of mind in knowing that everything is still "green" after a major update.</p> <hr> <p>For everyone who has responded with "just test before you deploy" and "don't you have a staging server?", I understand where you're coming from. I do have a staging server and a CI process set up. My unit tests do run and I make sure they all pass before an an update to production. </p> <p>I realize that in a perfect world I wouldn't be concerned with this. But I've seen it happen before. If a file is left out of the update or a SQL script isn't run, the effects are immediately apparent when running your unit tests but can go unnoticed for quite some time without them.</p> <p>What I'm asking here is if there is any way, if only to satisfy my own compulsive desires, to run a unit test on a server that I cannot install applications on or remote into (e.g. one which I will only have FTP access to in order to update files)?</p>

23091	0	How to write a spec that is productive? <p>I've seen different program managers write specs in different format. Almost every one has had his/her own style of writing a spec.</p> <p>On one hand are those wordy documents which given to a programmer are likely to cause him/her missing a few things. I personally dread the word documents spec...I think its because of my reading style...I am always speed reading things which I think will cause me to miss out on key points.</p> <p>On the other hand, I have seen this innovative specs written in Excel by one of our clients. The way he used to write the spec was kind of create a mock application in Excel and use some VBA to mock it. He would do things like on button click where should the form go or what action should it perform (in comments). </p> <p>On data form, he would display a form in cells and on each data entry cell he would comment on what valid values are, what validation should it perform etc. </p> <p>I think that using this technique, it was less likely to miss out on things that needed to be done. Also, it was much easier to unit test it for the developer. The tester too had a better understanding of the system as it 'performed' before actually being written.</p> <p>Visio is another tool to do screen design but I still think Excel has a better edge over it considering its VBA support and its functions.</p> <p>Do you think this should become a more popular way of writing spec? I know it involves a bit of extra work on part of project manager(or whoever is writing the spec) but the payoff is huge...I myself could see a lot of productivity gain from using it. And if there are any better formats of specs that would actually help programmer.</p>

The final line gets rid of all probesets that do not have corresponding gene symbols. Now the trouble is that most genes in this set are assigned to more than one probeset. You can see this by doing</p> <pre><code>gene_symbols = factor(fData(cd4T)$Gene.symbol) length(gene_symbols)-length(levels(gene_symbols)) [1] 6897 </code></pre> <p>So only 6897 of my 19794 probesets have unique probeset -> gene mappings. I'd like to somehow combine the expression levels of each probeset associated with each gene. I don't care much about the actual probe id for each probe. I'd like very much to end up with an ExpressionSet containing the merged information as all of my downstream analysis is designed to work with this class. </p> <p>I think I can write some code that will do this by hand, and make a new expression set from scratch. However, I'm assuming this can't be a new problem and that code exists to do it, using a statistically sound method to combine the gene expression levels. I'm guessing there's a proper name for this also but my googles aren't showing up much of use. Can anyone help?</p>

Will model checking ever become a more widely used developing practice that we should have in our toolkit?</p>

25455	0	What is the most efficient way to populate a time (or time range)? <p>While plenty of solutions exist for entering dates (such as calendars, drop-down menus, etc.), it doesn't seem like there are too many "standard" ways to ask for a time (or time range).</p> <p>I've personally tried drop-down menus for the hour, minute, and second fields (and sometimes an "AM/PM" field, as well). I've also tried several clock-like input devices, most of which are too hard to use for the typical end-user. I've even tried "pop-out" time selection menus (which allow you to, for example, hover over the hour "10" to receive a sub-menu that contains ":00",":15",":30", and ":45") -- but none of these methods seem natural.</p> <p>So far, the best (and most universal) method I have found is just using simple text fields and forcing a user to manually populate the hour, minute, and second. Alternatively, I've had good experiences creating something similar to Outlook's "Day View" which allows you to drag and drop an event to set the start and end times.</p> <p>Is there a "best way" to ask for this information? Is anybody using some type of time input widget that's really intuitive and easy to use? Or is there at least a way that's more efficient than using plain text boxes? ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­</p>

26383	0	Exception handling: Contract vs Exceptional approach <p>I know two approaches to Exception handling, lets have a look at them.</p> <ol> <li><p>Contract approach.</p> <p>When a method does not do what it says it will do in the method header, it will throw an exception. Thus the method &quot;promises&quot; that it will do the operation, and if it fails for some reason, it will throw an exception.</p> </li> <li><p>Exceptional approach.</p> <p>Only throw exceptions when something truly weird happens. You should not use exceptions when you can resolve the situation with normal control flow (If statements). You don't use Exceptions for control flow, as you might in the contract approach.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Lets use both approaches in different cases:</p> <p>We have a Customer class that has a method called OrderProduct.</p> <p>contract approach:</p> <pre><code>class Customer { public void OrderProduct(Product product) { if((m_credit - product.Price) &lt; 0) throw new NoCreditException(&quot;Not enough credit!&quot;); // do stuff } } </code></pre> <p>exceptional approach:</p> <pre><code>class Customer { public bool OrderProduct(Product product) { if((m_credit - product.Price) &lt; 0) return false; // do stuff return true; } } if !(customer.OrderProduct(product)) Console.WriteLine(&quot;Not enough credit!&quot;); else // go on with your life </code></pre> <p>Here I prefer the exceptional approach, as it is not truly Exceptional that a customer has no money assuming he did not win the lottery.</p> <p>But here is a situation I err on the contract style.</p> <p>Exceptional:</p> <pre><code>class CarController { // returns null if car creation failed. public Car CreateCar(string model) { // something went wrong, wrong model return null; } } </code></pre> <p>When I call a method called CreateCar, I damn wel expect a Car instance instead of some lousy null pointer, which can ravage my running code a dozen lines later. Thus I prefer contract to this one:</p> <pre><code>class CarController { public Car CreateCar(string model) { // something went wrong, wrong model throw new CarModelNotKnownException(&quot;Model unkown&quot;); return new Car(); } } </code></pre> <p>Which do style do you use? What do you think is best general approach to Exceptions?</p>

26743	0	Proper name space management in .NET XmlWriter <p>I use .NET XML technologies quite extensively on my work. One of the things the I like very much is the XSLT engine, more precisely the extensibility of it. However there one little piece which keeps being a source of annoyance. Nothing major or something we can't live with but it is preventing us from producing the beautiful XML we would like to produce. </p> <p>One of the things we do is transform nodes inline and importing nodes from one XML document to another. </p> <p>Sadly , when you save nodes to an <code>XmlTextWriter</code> (actually whatever <code>XmlWriter.Create(Stream)</code> returns), the namespace definitions get all thrown in there, regardless of it is necessary (previously defined) or not. You get kind of the following xml:</p> <pre><code>&lt;root xmlns:abx="http://bladibla"&gt; &lt;abx:child id="A"&gt; &lt;grandchild id="B"&gt; &lt;abx:grandgrandchild xmlns:abx="http://bladibla" /&gt; &lt;/grandchild&gt; &lt;/abx:child&gt; &lt;/root&gt; </code></pre> <p>Does anyone have a suggestion as to how to convince .NET to be efficient about its namespace definitions?</p> <p>PS. As an added bonus I would like to override the default namespace, changing it as I write a node.</p>

An R call to calculate Spearman's correlation looks as follows:</p> <pre><code>cor( rank(x), rank(y) ) </code></pre> <p>Also in R, a naïve calculation of a fitted generalized additive model (GAM):</p> <pre><code>data.frame( x, fitted( gam( y ~ s(x) ) ) ) </code></pre> <p>Here <code>x</code> represents the years from 1900 to 2009 and <code>y</code> is the average measurement (e.g., minimum temperature) for that year.</p> <p><strong>Problem</strong></p> <p>The fitted trend line (using GAM) is reasonably accurate, as you can see in the following picture:</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/X0gxV.png" /></p> <p>The problem is that the correlations (shown in the bottom left) do not accurately reflect how closely the model fits the data.</p> <p><strong>Possible Solution</strong></p> <p>One way to improve the accuracy of the correlation is to use a root mean square error (RMSE) calculation on binned data.</p> <p><strong>Questions</strong></p> <p><em>Q.1.</em> How would you implement the RMSE calculation on the binned data to get a correlation (between 0 and 1) of GAM's fit to the measurements, in the R language?</p> <p><em>Q.2.</em> Is there a better way to find the accuracy of GAM's fit to the data, and if so, what is it (e.g., root mean square deviation)?</p> <p><strong>Attempted Solution 1</strong></p> <ol> <li>Call the PL/R function using the observed amounts and the model (GAM) amounts: <pre><code>correlation_rmse := climate.plr_corr_rmse( v_amount, v_model );</code></pre></li> <li>Define <code>plr_corr_rmse</code> as follows (where <code>o</code> and <code>m</code> represent the observed and modelled data): <pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION climate.plr_corr_rmse( o double precision[], m double precision[]) RETURNS double precision AS $BODY$ sqrt( mean( o - m ) ^ 2 ) $BODY$ LANGUAGE 'plr' VOLATILE STRICT COST 100; </code></pre></li> </ol> <p>The <code>o - m</code> is wrong.

The solution isn't ideal as the number "5" is rather magical.</p> <pre><code>while( length(o) %% 5 != 0 ) { o &lt;- o[-length(o)] } omean &lt;- apply( matrix(o, 5), 2, mean ) </code></pre> <p>What other options are available?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Usually we install our .NET C# based site on a customer's server and maintain and support it remotely. However, every once in a while, for bigger development works and just to make things simpler (and faster!), we will copy the site to a local server.</p> <p>This is great, but has one pain - moving the site back to the customer. Now, If nothing was change on the customer's copy - no problem. However, it is the sad truth that sometime (read more often than I would like) some fixes were needed to be applied on the production server. Either because the customer needed it NOW or simply because it was major bug.</p> <p>I know that you can easily apply those bug fixes to the local copy as well, but this is an error prone process. So I'm setting my hopes on a distributed version control to help synchronize the two copies.</p> <p>Here is what I need:</p> <ul> <li>Easy to install - nothing else needed except the installer and admin rights.</li> <li>Can integrated in an existing website as a virtual directory and works on port 80 - no hassle with new DNS required.</li> <li>Excellent software</li> </ul> <p>That's it. Any ideas?</p> <hr> <h2>Some comments on the answers</h2> <p>First, thanks! much appreciated.</p> <p>I've looked at Mercurial and Bazaar and both look very good.

You cannot decorate these methods with the <strong>XmlIgnore</strong> attribute either, so we cannot stop it that way.</p> <p>My current solution is to remove the interface implementation (in this current application, its no real big deal, just made the code prettier).</p> <p><strong>Do I need to swallow my pride on this one and accept it cant be done?</strong> I know I have kinda pushed and got more out of the XmlSerializer than what was expected of it :)</p> <hr /> <h3>Edit</h3> <p>I should also add, I am currently working in framework 2.</p> <hr /> <h3>Update</h3> <p>I have accepted <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31799/preventing-xml-serialization-of-ienumerable-and-icollectiont-inherited-types#31810">lomaxx's answer</a>. In my scenario I cannot actually do this, but I do know it will work. Since their have been no other suggestions, I ended up removing the interface implementation from the code.</p>

3190672	1	Map Data with R World Regions <p>Lately I have seen some cool examples of mapping in R and wanted to give this a shot. I currently have ArcView at work, but my spatial join is not working correctly (most likely user error).</p> <p>Objective: I need a list of countries and what World Region they belong to. I have two layers (one country detail, the other region detail) and wanted to join the world region assignment onto each country. The join isn't working, so i figured I would come to the R community.</p> <p>What are my options? This is my first attempt at doing any mapping in R and maybe there is an easier/better solution. Eventually I want to take lat/long data and map it as well.</p> <p>Any insight will be much appreciated.</p> <p>Brock</p>

32227	0	Data model for a extensible web form <p>Suppose that I have a form that contains three 10 fields: field1..field10. I store the form data in one or more database tables, probably using 10 database columns. </p> <p>Now suppose a few months later that I want to add 3 more fields. And in the future I may add/delete fields from this form based on changing requirements. If I have a database column per form field, then I would have to make the corresponding changes to the database each time I change the form. This seems like a maintenance headache. There must be a more sophisticated way.</p> <p>So my question is, how do I design a data model that is loosely coupled with my UI?

Google knows about it, and we have done a load of SEO on it. All is well.</p> <p><strong>Except</strong>, we are about to relaunch <strong>my company, the GLOBAL brand</strong>, so we now need mycompany.com/uk, mycompany.com/us, and mycompany.com/au, for the various countries local content.

And worse, the Google bot appears to be 100% based in the US, so the US site (which is pretty much out LEAST important one of the three) will appear to be the main one.</p> <p><strong>We have thought about detecting the bot</strong>, and serving UK content, but it appears Google may smack us for that.</p> <p>Has anyone else come across this situation, and have a solution?</p>
32377	0	Test plans and how best to write them <p>We're trying to figure out the best way to write tests in our test plan. Specifically, when writing a test that is meant to be used by anyone including QA staff, should the steps in the test be very specific or more broad giving the tester more leeway in how the task can be accomplished. As a very simple example, if you're testing opening a document in word processing document, should the test read:</p> <ol> <li>Using the mouse, open the file menu</li> <li>Choose "Open File..." in the file menu</li> <li>In the open file dialog that appears, navigate to x and double-click the document called y</li> </ol> <p>OR </p> <ol> <li>Bring up the file open dialog</li> <li>Open the file y</li> </ol> <p>Now I realize one answer is probably going to be "it depends on what you're trying to test" but I'm trying to answer a broader question here: If the test steps are too specific do we risk a) making the testing process to laborious and tedious and more importantly b) do we risk missing something because we wrote down too specific a path to achieve a goal. Alternatively, if we make it broad do we depend too much on the whims of the tester at the time and lose crucial testing of paths that are more common to customers/clients?</p>

33510	0	What is the best approach to both modularity and platform independence? <p>I hope this question does not come off as broad as it may seem at first. I am designing a software application in my <code>&lt;sarcasm&gt;</code><em>voluminous</em><code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code> spare time. I would like it to be both cross-platform and modular. At this point, because I am still in the planning phase, I can pick practically any language and toolset.</p> <p>This makes things harder, not easier, because there are seemingly so many ways of accomplishing both of the goals (modularity, platform agnosticism). </p> <p>My basic premise is that security, data storage, interaction with the operating system, and configuration should all be handled by a "container" application - but most of the other functionality will be supplied through plug-in modules. If I had to describe it at a high level (without completely giving away my idea), it would be a single application that can do many different jobs, all dedicated to the same goal (there are lots of disparate things to do, but all the data has to interact and be highly available).</p> <p>This is not a new idea, and not particularly exotic. Yet I find myself wrestling with not so much how to do it (I can think of lots of ways), but which method is best.</p> <p>For example, I know that Eclipse practically embodies what I am describing, but I find Java applications in general (and Eclipse is no exception) to be too large and slow for what I need. Ditto desktop apps written Python and Ruby (which are excellent languages!) </p> <p>I don't mind recompiling the code base for different platforms as native exectables. Yet, C and C++ have their own set of issues.</p> <p>As a C# developer, I have a preference for managed code. But I am not at all sold on Mono, yet (I could be convinced).</p> <p>Does anyone have any ideas/experiences/ specific favorite frameworks to share?</p>

The second and lower levels DesignMode will always return FALSE.</p> <p>The standard hack has been to look at the name of the process that is running and if it is "DevEnv.EXE" then it must be studio thus DesignMode is really TRUE.</p> <p>The problem with that is looking for the ProcessName works its way around through the registry and other strange parts with the end result that the user might not have the required rights to see the process name. In addition this strange route is very slow. So we have had to pile additional hacks to use a singleton and if an error is thrown when asking for the process name then assume that DesignMode is FALSE.</p> <p>A nice clean way to determine DesignMode is in order. Acually getting Microsoft to fix it internally to the framework would be even better!</p>

The following code does so, but creates a legend for size, which is useless since size has no variable that can be mapped to it.</p> <pre><code>qplot(date,value,data=graph1,geom="line",colour=variable,xlab="",ylab="",size=1) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.3,0.3)) + opts(aspect.ratio = 2/(1+sqrt(5))) + scale_colour_manual("Variable",c(Line1="red",Line2="blue")) + opts(legend.size="none") </code></pre> <p>My plot consists of two lines representing a time series of two different variables over the same time span. The variable is mapped to color. If I try to influence the size of the line, qplot always tries to map "size" to another parameter and display another legend. </p> <p>I also followed <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2/browse_thread/thread/28eaca9ea56ce5cc/80faa8947fa6a01a?#80faa8947fa6a01a" rel="noreferrer">this</a> discussion, that ended with Hadley telling the others that removing a part of the legend is not implemented yet. I understand that adding another paramater to the mix implies the need of a legend for this parameter.

35991	0	Altering database tables in Django <p>I'm considering using Django for a project I'm starting (fyi, a browser-based game) and one of the features I'm liking the most is using <code>syncdb</code> to automatically create the database tables based on the Django models I define (a feature that I can't seem to find in any other framework). I was already thinking this was too good to be true when I saw this in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Syncdb will not alter existing tables</p> <p>syncdb will only create tables for models which have not yet been installed. It will never issue ALTER TABLE statements to match changes made to a model class after installation. Changes to model classes and database schemas often involve some form of ambiguity and, in those cases, Django would have to guess at the correct changes to make. There is a risk that critical data would be lost in the process.</p> <p>If you have made changes to a model and wish to alter the database tables to match, use the sql command to display the new SQL structure and compare that to your existing table schema to work out the changes.</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems that altering existing tables will have to be done &quot;by hand&quot;.</p> <p>What I would like to know is the best way to do this. Two solutions come to mind:</p> <ul> <li>As the documentation suggests, make the changes manually in the DB;</li> <li>Do a backup of the database, wipe it, create the tables again (with syncdb, since now it's creating the tables from scratch) and import the backed-up data (this might take too long if the database is big)</li> </ul> <p>Any ideas?</p>
36109	0	Quoting command-line arguments in shell scripts <p>The following shell script takes a list of arguments, turns Unix paths into WINE/Windows paths and invokes the given executable under WINE.</p> <pre><code>#! /bin/sh if [ "${1+set}" != "set" ] then echo "Usage; winewrap EXEC [ARGS...]" exit 1 fi EXEC="$1" shift ARGS="" for p in "$@"; do if [ -e "$p" ] then p=$(winepath -w $p) fi ARGS="$ARGS '$p'" done CMD="wine '$EXEC' $ARGS" echo $CMD $CMD </code></pre> <p>However, there's something wrong with the quotation of command-line arguments.</p> <pre><code>$ winewrap '/home/chris/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Microsoft Research/Z3-1.3.6/bin/z3.exe' -smt /tmp/smtlib3cee8b.smt Executing: wine '/home/chris/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Microsoft Research/Z3-1.3.6/bin/z3.exe' '-smt' 'Z: mp\smtlib3cee8b.smt' wine: cannot find ''/home/chris/.wine/drive_c/Program' </code></pre> <p>Note that:</p> <ol> <li>The path to the executable is being chopped off at the first space, even though it is single-quoted.</li> <li>The literal "\t" in the last path is being transformed into a tab character.</li> </ol> <p>Obviously, the quotations aren't being parsed the way I intended by the shell. How can I avoid these errors?</p> <p>EDIT: The "\t" is being expanded through two levels of indirection: first, <code>"$p"</code> (and/or <code>"$ARGS"</code>) is being expanded into <code>Z:\tmp\smtlib3cee8b.smt</code>; then, <code>\t</code> is being expanded into the tab character.

The problem is that the server closes the connection after about a minute due to inactivity, which is the time needed to process the data locally. Its a shared server, so the host won't bump up the timeout time.</p> <p>I think there are two possibilities to get around this 1) Open a connection before every database transaction and close it immediately after 2) Send some small 'ping' command to the server every 30 seconds or so to let the server know that I'm still there.</p> <p>I can implement the first fairly easily, but it seems pretty slow to constantly open and close connections.

Essentially the file ends up in the local application data and in an unsavoury sub-directory structure. (AppData / Local / <em>company</em> / <em>namespace_StrongName_gibberish</em> / <em>version</em> ).</p> <p>Is there a way to tell the LocalFileSettingsProvider to store the configuration file so the data will roam and perhaps in a less crazy folder structure? (or maybe an implementation of SettingsProvider that already does this?)</p>

3452206	1	How do I Sweave a multiple-file project? <p>I am writing my thesis in LaTeX and because things got a bit long for my taste, I had split it into several files. Let's call them <code>thesis.tex</code>, <code>intro.tex</code>, <code>mat_n_met.tex</code>, <code>rslts.tex</code> and <code>discsn.tex</code>. I have linked <code>intro.tex</code>, <code>mat_n_met.tex</code>, <code>rslts.tex</code> and <code>discsn.tex</code> through <code>thesis.tex</code> with <code>\include{intro}</code> (and so on...). I have also created a separate file called <code>r_crunching.Rnw</code> (that I run through Sweave) that holds a chunk that runs the R script with data analysis and chunks that produce pdf outputs of graphs that I embed via <code>\includegraphics</code> (in e.g., <code>rslts.tex</code>). Still following?</p> <p>If I run a Rnw (i.e. I renamed <code>rslts.tex</code> to <code>rslts.Rnw</code>) without "a link" to the chunk with the R script, you will get a <code>Sweave()</code> error saying the reference in <code>\Sexpr{}</code> doesn't exist. Is there a way, without merging all the files into a single .Rnw, to call <code>\Sexpr{}</code> in say <code>rslts.Rnw</code>?</p> <p>Other methods how to accomplish this are welcome.</p>

3463837	1	Is it good practice to update R packages often? <p>I've started to use R a little while ago and am not sure how often to update the installed packages (at this time, I'm using mostly ggplot2 and rattle). One one hand it's the typical geek impulse to have the latest version :-) On the other, updates can break functionality and, as an R beginner, I don't want to waste time looking into package incompatibilities and reinstalling libraries, it's almost certain I wouldn't notice any difference with an improved package.</p> <p>With other applications I have a sense developed from experience on how often to upgrade, how much to wait between the release of an upgrade and installing it and so on. But I'm in the dark with regards to R.</p> <p>And to be clear: I'm not talking about R itself, but its libraries.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>

39304	0	Do C++ logging frameworks sacrifice reusability? <p>In C++, there isn't a de-facto standard logging tool. In my experience, shops roll their own. This creates a bit of a problem, however, when trying to create reusable software components. If everything in your system depends on the logging component, this makes the software less reusable, basically forcing any downstream projects to take your logging framework along with the components they really want. </p> <p>IOC (dependency injection) doesn't really help with the problem since your components would need to depend on a logging abstraction. Logging components themselves can add dependencies on file I/O, triggering mechanisms, and other possibly unwanted dependencies. </p> <p>Does adding a dependency to your proprietary logging framework sacrifice the reusability of the component?</p>

40335	0	How to tell which disk Windows Used to Boot <p>I'm need to find a method to programmatically determine which disk drive Windows is using to boot. In other words, I need a way from Windows to determine which drive the BIOS is using to boot the whole system. </p> <p>Does Windows expose an interface to discover this? With how big the Windows API is, I'm hoping there is something buried in there that might do the trick.</p> <p>Terry</p> <p>p.s. Just reading the first sectors of the hard disk isn't reveling anything. On my dev box I have two hard disks, and when I look at the contents of the first couple of sectors on either of the hard disks I have a standard boiler plate MBR.</p> <p>Edit to clarify a few things. The way I want to identify the device is with a string which will identify a physical disk drive (as opposed to a logical disk drive). Physical disk drives are of the form "\\.\PHYSICALDRIVEx" where x is a number. On the other hand, a logical drive is identified by a string of the form, "\\.\x" where x is a drive letter.</p> <p>Edit to discuss a few of the ideas that were thrown out. Knowing which logical volume Windows used to boot doesn't help me here. Here is the reason. Assume that C: is using a mirrored RAID setup. Now, that means we have at least two physical drives. Now, I get the mapping from Logical Drive to Physical Drive and I discover that there are two physical drives used by that volume. Which one did Windows use to boot? Of course, this is assuming that the physical drive Windows used to boot is the same physical drive that contains the MBR. </p>

Messages are hash-like structures, and used these together with a number of preprocessor macros to implemented simple pattern matching.</p> <p>Right now, I can use the following code to send a message:</p> <pre><code>(new Message(this)) ->set("foo", "bar") ->set("baz", 123) ->send(recipient); </code></pre> <p>And the following to do simple pattern matching (<code>qDebug</code> and <code>qPrintable</code> are Qt-specific):</p> <pre><code>receive_and_match(m) match_key("foo") { qDebug("foo: %s", qPrintable(m->value("foo").toString())); } or_match_key("baz") { qDebug("baz: %d", m->value("baz").toInt()); } or_match_ignore end_receive </code></pre> <p>However, this looks a bit hackish to me, and isn't very robust.</p> <p>How would you do it?

43199	0	Internationalized page properties in Tapestry 4.1.2 <p>The login page in my Tapestry application has a property in which the password the user types in is stored, which is then compared against the value from the database. If the user enters a password with multi-byte characters, such as:</p> <pre><code>áéíóú </code></pre> <p>...an inspection of the return value of getPassword() (the abstract method for the corresponding property) gives:</p> <pre><code>Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³Ãº </code></pre> <p>Clearly, that's not encoded properly. Yet Firebug reports that the page is served up in UTF-8, so presumably the form submission request would also be encoded in UTF-8. Inspecting the value as it comes from the database produces the correct string, so it wouldn't appear to be an OS or IDE encoding issue. I have not overridden Tapestry's default value for org.apache.tapestry.output-encoding in the .application file, and the Tapestry 4 <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4/UsersGuide/configuration.html#configuration.properties" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> indicates that the default value for the property is UTF-8.</p> <p>So why does Tapestry appear to botch the encoding when setting the property?</p> <p>Relevant code follows:</p> <h2>Login.html</h2> <pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;html jwcid="@Shell" doctype='html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"' ...&gt; &lt;body jwcid="@Body"&gt; ... &lt;form jwcid="@Form" listener="listener:attemptLogin" ...&gt; ... &lt;input jwcid="password"/&gt; ... &lt;/form&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <h2>Login.page</h2> <pre class="lang-jsp prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE page-specification PUBLIC "-//Apache Software Foundation//Tapestry Specification 4.0//EN" "http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/dtd/Tapestry_4_0.dtd"&gt; &lt;page-specification class="mycode.Login"&gt; ... &lt;property name="password" /&gt; ... &lt;component id="password" type="TextField"&gt; &lt;binding name="value" value="password"/&gt; &lt;binding name="hidden" value="true"/&gt; ... &lt;/component&gt; ... &lt;/page-specification&gt; </code></pre> <h2>Login.java</h2> <pre><code>... public abstract class Login extends BasePage { ... public abstract String getPassword(); ... public void attemptLogin() { // At this point, inspecting getPassword() returns // the incorrectly encoded String. } ... } </code></pre> <h2>Updates</h2> <p>@Jan Soltis: Well, if I inspect the value that comes from the database, it displays the correct string, so it would seem that my editor, OS and database are all encoding the value correctly. I've also checked my .application file; it does not contain an org.apache.tapestry.output-encoding entry, and the Tapestry 4 <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4/UsersGuide/configuration.html#configuration.properties" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> indicates that the default value for this property is UTF-8. I have updated the description above to reflect the answers to your questions.</p> <p>@myself: Solution found.</p>

44005	0	Propagation of Oracle Transactions Between C++ and Java <p>We have an existing C++ application that we are going to gradually replace with a new Java-based system. Until we have completely reimplemented everything in Java we expect the C++ and Java to have to communicate with each other (RMI, SOAP, messaging, etc - we haven't decided).</p> <p>Now my manager thinks we'll need the Java and C++ sides to participate in the same Oracle DB transaction. This is related to, but different from the usual distrbuted transaction problem of having a single process co-ordinate 2 transactional resources, such as a DB and a message queue.</p> <p>I think propagating a transaction across processes is a terrible idea from a performance and stability point-of-view, but I am still going to be asked for a solution.</p> <p>I am familiar with XA transactions and I've done some work with the JBoss Transaction Manager, but my googling hasn't turned up anything good on propagating an XA transaction between 2 processes.</p> <p>We are using Spring on the Java side and their documentation explicitly states they do not provide any help with transaction propagation.</p> <p>We are not planning on using a traditional Java EE server (for example: IBM Websphere), which may have support for propagation (not that I can find any definitive documentation).</p> <p>Any help or pointers on solutions is greatly appreciated.</p>

44080	0	Does Microsoft ASP.NET Ajax Cause DOM Object Leaks? <p>We've been using "Drip" to try and identify why pages with UpdatePanels in them tend to use a lot of client-side memory. With a page with a regular postback, we are seeing 0 leaks detected by Drip. However, when we add an update panel to the mix, every single DOM object that is inside of the update panel appears to leak (according to Drip).</p> <p>I am not certain is Drip is reliable enough to report these kinds of things - the reported leaks do seem to indicate Drip is modifying the page slightly. </p> <p>Does anyone have any experience with this? Should I panic and stop using Microsoft Ajax? I'm not above doubting Microsoft, but it seems fishy to me that it could be <em>this</em> bad.</p> <p>Also, if you know of a tool that is better than Drip, that would be helpful as well.</p>
44087	0	IE6 and XML prolog <p>With an XML prolog like </p> <pre><code>? xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"? &gt; </code></pre> <p>and a Doctype like </p> <pre><code>!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd"&gt; </code></pre> <p>I can get my page to render as expected. However, in IE7 the same page does not render correctly. (a span inside a div does not align vertically) Articles on the web suggest that XML prolog + doctype will throw IE6 into quirks mode. However <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/15/467901.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a> seems to suggest otherwise, although it does not mention the version (is it 6 or 7) it applies to, though the article is dated sep 2005 which makes me believe it applies to IE6</p> <p>Does XML Prolog + doc type throw IE6 into quirks mode? What about IE7? Any recommendations on for or against using the prolog + doctype?</p>
44176	0	Searching subversion history (full text) <p>Is there a way to perform a full text search of a subversion repository, including all the history?</p> <p>For example, I've written a feature that I used somewhere, but then it wasn't needed, so I svn rm'd the files, but now I need to find it again to use it for something else. The svn log probably says something like "removed unused stuff", and there's loads of checkins like that.</p> <p><strong>Edit 2016-04-15:</strong> Please note that what is asked here by the term "full text search", is to <strong>search the actual diffs of the commit history, and not filenames and/or commit messages</strong>. I'm pointing this out because the author's phrasing above does not reflect that very well - since in his example he might as well be only looking for a filename and/or commit message. Hence a lot of the <code>svn log</code> answers and comments.</p>

44364	0	How can I avoid global state? <p>So, I was reading the Google testing blog, and it says that global state is bad and makes it hard to write tests. I believe it--my code is difficult to test right now. So how do I avoid global state?</p> <p>The biggest things I use global state (as I understand it) for is managing key pieces of information between our development, acceptance, and production environments. For example, I have a static class named "Globals" with a static member called "DBConnectionString." When the application loads, it determines which connection string to load, and populates Globals.DBConnectionString. I load file paths, server names, and other information in the Globals class.</p> <p>Some of my functions rely on the global variables. So, when I test my functions, I have to remember to set certain globals first or else the tests will fail. I'd like to avoid this.</p> <p>Is there a good way to manage state information? (Or am I understanding global state incorrectly?)</p>

I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, <strong>everything</strong> is the same.</p> <p>The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:</p> <pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK Server WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2 Date Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT Vary Cookie Content-Length 2301 Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 </code></pre> <p>Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:</p> <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT Server Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch Vary Cookie Content-Length 2301 Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 </code></pre> <p>So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.</p> <p>To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is "zoomed in" by about 10%. For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide. Everything else on the page, (other images, text, spacing, etc) is also proportionately larger.</p> <p>This is all in Firefox 3. I don't have any other browsers available to test with at the moment.</p> <p>Has anyone else encountered any bizarre behavior anything like this before? I am at a loss.</p>
3780776	1	How do I include plotting symbol glyphs in a text annotation in ggplot2? <p>I'd like to include the glyph used in a scatter plot directly in a text annotation. </p> <p>E.g., Suppose I have: </p> <pre><code>g &lt;- g + geom_text(aes(x=14, y = 17, label="GOOD")) </code></pre> <p>where g is a scatter plot w/ a linear trend line, labeled by "GOOD" at (14,17).

45202	0	IoC Container Configuration/Registration <p>I absolutely need to use an IoC container for decoupling dependencies in an ever increasingly complex system of enterprise services. The issue I am facing is one related to configuration (a.k.a. registration). We currently have 4 different environments -- development to production and in between. These environments have numerous configurations that slightly vary from environment to environment; however, in all cases that <em>I can currently think of</em>, dependencies between components do not differ from environment to environment, though I could have missed something and/or this could obviously change. </p> <p>So, the ultimate question is, does anybody have a similar experience using an IoC framework? Or, can anybody recommend one framework over another that would provide flexible registration be it through some sort of convention or simplified configuration information? Would I still be able to benefit from a fluent interface or am I stuck with XML -- I'd like to avoid XML-hell.</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> This is a .Net environment and I have been looking at Windsor, Ninject and Autofac. They all seem to now support both methods of registration (fluent and XML), though Autofac's support for lambda expressions seems to be a little different than the others. Anybody use that in a similar multi-deployment environment?</p>

I don't do many physical deletes, so I don't think that its just deleted records. DBCC SHRINK doesn't make the file smaller. But, if I dump the table to a new, empty database, the size goes down about 80%. Instead of the 7gb I have in this table in the current database, I end up with about 1.5gb in the fresh database. Its as if sql server is allocating too much memory. Anyone encountered this before?

And to keep the threshold of using the site at a very low place, I want to not use the standard login with username/password. (And I don't want to hassle my users with something like OpenID either. Goes to user type.)</p> <p>So I'm thinking that the users shall be able to log in by sending an email to login@domain.com with no subject or content required. And they will get, in reply, an email with a link that will log them in (it will contain a hash). Also I will let the users do some actions without even visiting the site at all, just send an email with command@domain.com and the command will be carried out. I will assume that the users and their email providers takes care of their email account security and as such there is no need for it on my site.</p> <p>Now, how do I go from an email is sent to an account that is not read by humans to there being fired off some script (basically a "dummy browser client" calls an url( and the cakephp will take care of the rest)?</p> <hr> <p>I have never used a cron job before, but I do think I understand their purpose or how they generally work.

If it's run as a cron job it would only check every X minutes and users would get a lag in their response (if i understand it correctly). </p> <p>Since there will be different email addresses for different commands, like <strong>login</strong>@domain.com and I know what to do and how to do it to based on the sender email, i dont even need the content, subject or any other headers from the email.</p> <hr> <p>There is a lot of worry about security of this application, I understand the issues, but without giving away my concept, I dont think it is a big issue for what I am doing. Also about the usability issue, there really isnt any. It's just gonna be login to provide changes on a users profile if/when they need that and one other command. And this is the main email and is very easy to remember and the outset of this whole concept.</p>

Same is true for some of the reports in Google Analytics . . . the printed reports as PDF's are beautiful. How do they do that?

48458	0	Project structure for Google App Engine <p>I started an application in Google App Engine right when it came out, to play with the technology and work on a pet project that I had been thinking about for a long time but never gotten around to starting. The result is <a href="http://www.bowlsk.com" rel="noreferrer">BowlSK</a>. However, as it has grown, and features have been added, it has gotten really difficult to keep things organized - mainly due to the fact that this is my first python project, and I didn't know anything about it until I started working.</p> <p>What I have:</p> <ul> <li>Main Level contains: <ul> <li>all .py files (didn't know how to make packages work)</li> <li>all .html templates for main level pages</li> </ul></li> <li>Subdirectories: <ul> <li>separate folders for css, images, js, etc.</li> <li>folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Example:<br/> <a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.bowlsk.com/</a> maps to HomePage (default package), template at "index.html"<br/> <a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130" rel="noreferrer">http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130</a> maps to ViewSeriesPage (again, default package), template at "games/view-series.html"</p> <p>It's nasty. How do I restructure? I had 2 ideas:</p> <ul> <li><p>Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?</p> <ul> <li>Subfolder for code. Does this have to be my first package?</li> <li>Subfolder for templates. Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy</li> <li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li> </ul></li> <li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p> <ul> <li>Subfolder for code + templates. This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other. Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes? I'd like the folder to be "src", but I don't want my classes to be "src.WhateverPage"</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Is there a best practice? With Django 1.0 on the horizon, is there something I can do now to improve my ability to integrate with it when it becomes the official GAE templating engine? I would simply start trying these things, and seeing which seems better, but pyDev's refactoring support doesn't seem to handle package moves very well, so it will likely be a non-trivial task to get all of this working again.</p>

I had been using R for text mining already. I wanted to use R for large scale text processing and for experiments with topic modeling. I started reading tutorials and working on some of those. I will now put down my understanding of each of the tools:</p> <p>1) R text mining toolbox: Meant for local (client side) text processing and it uses the XML library </p> <p>2) Hive: Hadoop interative, provides the framework to call map/reduce and also provides the DFS interface for storing files on the DFS. </p> <p>3) RHIPE: R Hadoop integrated environment</p> <p>4) Elastic MapReduce with R: a MapReduce framework for those who do not have their own clusters</p> <p>5) Distributed Text Mining with R: An attempt to make seamless move form local to server side processing, from R-tm to R-distributed-tm</p> <p>I have the following questions and confusions about the above packages</p> <p>1) Hive and RHIPE and the distributed text mining toolbox need you to have your own clusters. Right?</p> <p>2) If I have just one computer how would DFS work in case of HIVE </p> <p>3) Are we facing with the problem of duplication of effort with the above packages?</p> <p>I am hoping to get insights on the above questions in the next few days</p>

49263	0	Approximate string matching algorithms <p>Here at work, we often need to find a string from the list of strings that is the closest match to some other input string. Currently, we are using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The algorithm often returns a lot of false-positives (if we set the minimum-score too low), sometimes it doesn't find a match when it should (when the minimum-score is too high) and, most of the times, we need to check the results by hand. We thought we should try other alternatives.</p> <p>Do you have any experiences with the algorithms? Do you know how the algorithms compare to one another?</p> <p>I'd really appreciate some advice.</p> <p>PS: We're coding in C#, but you shouldn't care about it - I'm asking about the algorithms in general.</p> <hr> <p>Oh, I'm sorry I forgot to mention that.</p> <p>No, we're not using it to match duplicate data. We have a list of strings that we are looking for - we call it search-list. And then we need to process texts from various sources (like RSS feeds, web-sites, forums, etc.) - we extract parts of those texts (there are entire sets of rules for that, but that's irrelevant) and we need to match those against the search-list. If the string matches one of the strings in search-list - we need to do some further processing of the thing (which is also irrelevant).</p> <p>We can not perform the normal comparison, because the strings extracted from the outside sources, most of the times, include some extra words etc.</p> <p>Anyway, it's not for duplicate detection.</p>

My tables contains a lot of variables, which can be easily grouped by their names, which is why I use these pattern identification. It works well so far and c&amp;p these few lines is not that much of an effort. However, is it reasonable to write these lines into one function / method and let the others inherit?</p> <p>Most help I read on OO in R so far used examples that assigned attributes to data and then used generic functions.

4054585	1	How can I contribute to base R in small ways? <p>Occasionally I see small ways I could improve either R (recently the IQR command) and R documentation (just this week perhaps elaborating differences among and better interconnecting aggregate, tapply, and by).

I looked into the developer site and it seems that my options are either to attempt to become a full fledged developer or create packages, neither of which fit what I wish to accomplish.</p> <p>I did propose IQR changes on the R mailing list but got no response so I figure that's going nowhere. </p> <p>And to clarify, I'm talking about base-R.

49737	0	Use-cases for reflection <p>Recently I was talking to a co-worker about C++ and lamented that there was no way to take a string with the name of a class field and extract the field with that name; in other words, it lacks reflection. He gave me a baffled look and asked when anyone would ever need to do such a thing.</p> <p>Off the top of my head I didn't have a good answer for him, other than "hey, I need to do it right now". So I sat down and came up with a list of some of the things I've actually done with reflection in various languages. Unfortunately, most of my examples come from my web programming in Python, and I was hoping that the people here would have more examples. Here's the list I came up with:</p> <ol> <li><p>Given a config file with lines like<br> x = "Hello World!"<br> y = 5.0<br> dynamically set the fields of some <code>config</code> object equal to the values in that file. (This was what I wished I could do in C++, but actually couldn't do.)</p></li> <li><p>When sorting a list of objects, sort based on an arbitrary attribute given that attribute's name from a config file or web request.</p></li> <li><p>When writing software that uses a network protocol, reflection lets you call methods based on string values from that protocol. For example, I wrote an IRC bot that would translate<br> <code>!some_command arg1 arg2</code><br> into a method call <code>actions.some_command(arg1, arg2)</code> and print whatever that function returned back to the IRC channel.</p></li> <li><p>When using Python's __getattr__ function (which is sort of like method_missing in Ruby/Smalltalk) I was working with a class with a whole lot of statistics, such as late_total. For every statistic, I wanted to be able to add _percent to get that statistic as a percentage of the total things I was counting (for example, stats.late_total_percent). Reflection made this very easy.</p></li> </ol> <p>So can anyone here give any examples from their own programming experiences of times when reflection has been helpful? The next time a co-worker asks me why I'd "ever want to do something like that" I'd like to be more prepared.</p>

49757	0	What is a good design when trying to build objects from a list of key value pairs? <p>So if I have a method of parsing a text file and returning a <strong>list</strong> <em>of a</em> <strong>list</strong> <em>of</em> <strong>key value pairs</strong>, and want to create objects from the kvps returned (each list of kvps represents a different object), what would be the best method?</p> <p>The first method that pops into mind is pretty simple, just keep a list of keywords:</p> <pre><code>private const string NAME = &quot;name&quot;; private const string PREFIX = &quot;prefix&quot;; </code></pre> <p>and check against the keys I get for the constants I want, defined above. This is a fairly core piece of the project I'm working on though, so I want to do it well; does anyone have any more robust suggestions (not saying there's anything inherently un-robust about the above method - I'm just asking around)?</p> <h1>Edit:</h1> <p>More details have been asked for. I'm working on a little game in my spare time, and I am building up the game world with configuration files. There are four - one defines all creatures, another defines all areas (and their locations in a map), another all objects, and a final one defines various configuration options and things that don't fit else where. With the first three configuration files, I will be creating objects based on the content of the files - it will be quite text-heavy, so there will be a lot of strings, things like names, plurals, prefixes - that sort of thing.

4092425	1	Ensuring reproducibility in an R environment <p>I work in a computational biology lab, where we have several folks working on multiple projects, mostly in R (which is what I care about for this post). In the past, people would simply develop their code for each project, which may or may not involve boilerplate code copied over from previous projects. One thing that I've pushed over the years was to bring some centralized structure to this mess and have people identify common patterns such that we can turn these repeated/common blocks of code into packages for all of the many reasons one might think that is a good thing to do. So now our folks are using a mix of centralized packages/routines within their project specific scripts. </p> <p>There's one gotcha here. We have a mandate from the powers that be that every script for every project need to be 100% reproducible over time to the best of our ability (and this includes 100% of all code we have direct access to, including our packages). That is, if I call function foo in package bar with parameter A to get result X today, 4 years from now I should get the exact same result. (erroneous output due to bugs is excepted here)</p> <p>The topic of reproducibility has come up now and then in R within various circles, but typically it seems to be discussed in terms of reproducibility of process (e.g. vignettes). This is not the same thing - I can run a vignette today and then run the same code 6 months from now using updated packages and receive wildly different results.</p> <p>The solution that's been agreed upon (which I'm not a fan of) is that if a function or package needs to be changed in a non-backwards compatible change that it simply gets a new name. Thus, if we needed to radically change function foo(), it'd be called foo2(), and if that needs a radical change it gets called foo3(). This ensures that any script that called foo() will always get the original result, while allowing things to march forward within the package repository. It works, but I really dislike this - it seems aesthetically extremely cluttered, and I worry that it will lead to mass confusion over time having packages bar, bar2, bar3, bar4 ... functions foo1, foo2, foo3, etc. </p> <p>The problem is that I haven't come up with an alternate solution that's really better. One possibility would be to note version numbers of packages, R, etc and make sure those are loaded, but that has multiple problems - not the least of which is that it relies on proper package versioning discipline and that's prone to error. Also, this alternative was already rejected ;) Ideally what we'd have is some sort of notion of devel &amp; release as most of these changes tend to happen earlier on and then level off with changes happening much less frequently. OTOH what devel really means here is "not actually in a package yet" (which we do), but it can be hard to determine exactly at what point is the right one to transport stuff over. Invariably the moment you think you're safe, that's when you realize you're not.</p> <p>So with all this in mind, I'm curious if anyone else out there has dealt with similar situations, and how they might have resolved things.</p> <p>edit: just to be clear, by non-backwards compatible, I'm not just talking about APIs and such, but also outputs for a given set of inputs. </p>

What I'm doing right now is ugly and I'd like to avoid it as much as I can: I call gwhois command and parse its output. Ugly.</p> <p>I did some search to try to find a pythonic way to do this task. Generally I got quite much nothing - <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2000-March/028122.html" rel="noreferrer">this old discussion list link</a> has a way to check if domain exist. Quite not what I was looking for... But still, it was best anwser Google gave me - everything else is just a bunch of unanwsered questions.</p> <p>Any of you have succeeded to get some method up and running? I'd very much appreciate some tips, or should I just do it the opensource-way, sit down and code something by myself? :) </p>

50704	0	What is a good way to format logs? <p>I'm designing an application which includes the need to log all incoming messages I receive from a Telnet connection. The text is largely plain though can include ANSI tags that provide text colour and formatting (16 colours, bold, underline, etc).</p> <p>I'm would like to format my logs to store the text with formatting, date/time and potentially other meta data later. My first thoughts was all XML but this could impact my ability to write a fast search tool later. My current idea is Date/Time + text in one file with meta-data stored in another XML file, referenced by line number.</p> <p>Is this a good solution? Also, where and how should I store the formatting commands? The original ANSI tags would disrupt the plain but having them in two different files might be awkward.</p> <p>Additional: Thanks to some answers so far, though I should mention that most of the time the messages will be person to person communications rather than system messages. A more primitive IRC of sorts. Its up to my user to decide later (by adding meta data) which messages were important. This is the raw on the record log that filtered or edited logs might derive from.</p>

I guess I should have specified that I was running Emacs+ESS on a Mac primarily (which disqualifies COM and Deducer), though I also switch to Linux and Windows on occasion. I guess View() still is the best multi-platform solution that I could find...</p>

51146	0	Win32 ToolTip disappears never to re-appear with Commctl 6 <p>I'm creating a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760250&#40;VS.85&#41;.aspx" rel="noreferrer">ToolTip</a> window and adding tools to it using the flags TTF_IDISHWND | TTF_SUBCLASS. (c++, win32)</p> <p>I have a manifest file such that my program uses the new WindowsXP themes (comctrl32 version 6).</p> <p>When I hover over a registered tool, the tip appears.<br> Good.<br> When I click the mouse, the tip disappears.<br> Ok.<br> However, moving away from the tool and back again does not make the tip re-appear. I need to hover over a different tool and then come back to my tool to get the tip to come back.</p> <p>When I remove my manifest file (to use the older non-XP comctrl32), the problem goes away.</p> <p>After doing some experimentation, I discovered the following differences between ToolTips in Comctl32 version 5 (old) and Comctl32 version 6 (new):</p> <ul> <li><p>New TTF_TRANSPARENT ToolTips (when used In-Place) actually return HTCLIENT from WM_NCITTEST if a mouse button is down, thus getting WM_LBUTTONDOWN and stealing focus for a moment before vanishing. This causes the application's border to flash.</p></li> <li><p>Old TTF_TRANSPARENT ToolTips always return HTTRANSPARENT from WM_NCHITTEST, and thus never get WM_LBUTTONDOWN themselves and never steal focus. (This seems to be just aesthetic, but may impact the next point...)</p></li> <li><p>New ToolTips seem not to get WM_TIMER events after a mouse-click, and only resume getting (a bunch of) timer events after being de-activated and re-activated. Thus, they do not re-display their tip window after a mouse click and release.</p></li> <li><p>Old ToolTips get a WM_TIMER message as soon as the mouse is moved again after click/release, so they are ready to re-display their tip.</p></li> </ul> <p>Thus, as a comctl32 workaround, I had to:</p> <ul> <li><p>subclass the TOOLTIPS_CLASS window and always return HTTRANSPARENT from WM_NCHITTEST if the tool asked for transparency.</p></li> <li><p>avoid using TTF_SUBCLASS and rather process the mouse messages myself so I could de-activate/re-activate upon receiving WM_xBUTTONUP.</p></li> </ul> <p>I assume that the change in internal behavior was to accommodate the new "clickable" features in ToolTips like hyperlinks, but the hover behavior appears to be thus broken.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a better solution than my subclass workaround? Am I missing some other point?</p>

4172667	1	R: how to store a vector of vectors <p>I'm trying to write a function to determine the euclidean distance between x (one point) and y (a set of n points). How should I pass y to the function? Until now, I used a matrix like that:</p> <pre><code> [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 0 2 1 [2,] 1 1 1 </code></pre> <p>Which would pass the points (0,2,1) and (1,1,1) to that function.</p> <p>However, when I pass x as a normal (column) vector, the two variables don't match in the function. I either have to transpose x or y, or save a vector of vectors an other way.</p> <p>My question: What is the standard way to save more than one vector in R? (my matrix y)<br> Is it just my y transposed or maybe a list or dataframe?</p>

51859	0	Using Makefile instead of Solution/Project files under Visual Studio (2005) <p>Does anyone have experience using makefiles for Visual Studio C++ builds (under VS 2005) as opposed to using the project/solution setup. For us, the way that the project/solutions work is not intuitive and leads to configuruation explosion when you are trying to tweak builds with specific compile time flags.</p> <p>Under Unix, it's pretty easy to set up a makefile that has its default options overridden by user settings (or other configuration setting). But doing these types of things seems difficult in Visual Studio.</p> <p>By way of example, we have a project that needs to get build for 3 different platforms. Each platform might have several configurations (for example debug, release, and several others). One of my goals on a newly formed project is to have a solution that can have all platform build living together, which makes building and testing code changes easier since you aren't having to open 3 different solutions just to test your code. But visual studio will require 3 * (number of base configurations) configurations. i.e. PC Debug, X360 Debug, PS3 Debug, etc.</p> <p>It seems like a makefile solution is much better here. Wrapped with some basic batchfiles or scripts, it would be easy to keep the configuration explotion to a minimum and only maintain a small set of files for all of the different builds that we have to do.</p> <p>However, I have no experience with makefiles under visual studio and would like to know if others have experiences or issues that they can share.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p>(post edited to mention that these are C++ builds)</p>

My web application (C#, .Net 3.0, etc) has Themes, CSS sheets and, of course, inline style definitions. Now that's alot of chefs adding stuff to the soup. All of this results, not surprisingly, in my pages having bizarre styling on occasion.</p> <p>I am sure that all these styles are applied in a hierarchical method (although I am not sure of that order). The issue is that each style is applied as a "transparent" layer which just masks what it is applying. This is, I feel, a good idea as you can specifiy styles for the whole and then one-off them as needed. Unfortunately I can't tell from which layer the style actually came from.</p> <p>I could solve this issue by explicitly expressing the style at all layers but that gets bulky and hard to manage and the page(s) works 80% of the time. I just need to figure out where that squirrelly 20% came from.</p>

55639	0	How do you communicate between Windows Vista Session 0 and Desktop? <p>In prior versions of Windows before Vista you could have a Windows Service interact with the current logged in desktop user to easy display information on the screen from the service. In Windows Vista Session 0 was added for security to isolate the services from the desktop. What is an easy way to communicate between a service and an application running outside of Session 0? So far I have gotten around this by using TCP/IP to communicate between the two but it seems to be kind of a sloppy way to do it.</p>
55709	0	Streaming large files in a java servlet <p>I am building a java server that needs to scale. One of the servlets will be serving images stored in Amazon S3.</p> <p>Recently under load, I ran out of memory in my VM and it was after I added the code to serve the images so I'm pretty sure that streaming larger servlet responses is causing my troubles.</p> <p>My question is : is there any best practice in how to code a java servlet to stream a large (>200k) response back to a browser when read from a database or other cloud storage?</p> <p>I've considered writing the file to a local temp drive and then spawning another thread to handle the streaming so that the tomcat servlet thread can be re-used. This seems like it would be io heavy.</p> <p>Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

55953	0	Can't make an SSL Connection <p>I'm using a device that's got GPRS media to connect to a PC running stunnel. On TCPIP connections, the number of sessions is limitless. However, when it comes to SSL connections, it could only go as far as 1062 successful sessions. I've tried it like 3 times but makes no difference. I've checked the OpenSSL codes and I couldn't seem to find any code block that limits SSL connection to 1062. On SSL's point of view, is there anything that limits the number of connections? </p> <hr> <p>Yes, I'm using a postpaid phone SIM, but there isn't any problem with TCPIP. It only happens with SSL connections. We've tried connecting to other PC's as well using same OpenSSL stunnel, but only ends up to 1062 connections. </p>

56005	0	.NET serialization class design issue <p>We have a rather large object graph that needs to be serialized and deserialized in a lot of different ways (modes). In some modes we want certain properties to be deserialized and in some we don't. In future modes it might also be possible that there are more options for properties than yes or no. The problem is now how we implement these modes. </p> <p><strong>Approach A (use deserialization constructor and ISerializable.GetObjectData):</strong></p> <p>If we let each object of the graph serialize itself using a deserialization constructor we get a lot switches for all the different modes of deserialization. The advantage of this approach however is that all the deserialization logic is at one location and if we add new properties we just need to modify the ISerializable.GetObjectData and the deserialization constructor. Another advantage is that the object might take internal states into account that might be exposed publically. The most important disadvantage is that we dataobject itself needs to know about all possible serialization modes. If we need a new mode we need to modify the dataobjects.</p> <p><strong>Approach B (Deserialization Factory Classes/Methods ):</strong></p> <p>Another approach would be to have some sort Deserialization Factory Classes/Methods one for each mode that does the serialization and deserialization externally (e.g. GraphSerializer.SerializeObjectTypeX(ObjectTypeX objectToSerialze). The advantage here is that whenever we want a new mode we just add a new Factory Class/Method and our Dataobject do not get cluttered with all the serialization modes that get introduced. The main disadvantage here is that I would have to write the same serialization code over and over for all the different modes. If two modes differ just in one or two properties but I would have to implement the complete logic for the whole graph again. When I add a new property to a dataobject I need to update all the factory classes.</p> <p>So I wonder if there is a better approach to this IMHO general problem. Or even a best practise in .NET? Or maybe I am just approaching the whole thing from a wrong perspective?</p>

56716	0	Architecture for modeling <p>A common solution to building a model of a system which consists of many items of different types is to create a modular system, where each module is responsible for particular type. For example, there will be module for wombats WombatModule:IModule, where IModule interface has methods like GetCount() (to find number of wombats) and Update() (to update all wombats' state).</p> <p>More object-oriented approach would be to have class for every item type and create an instance for every item. That will make class Wombat:IItem with methods like Update() (to update this one wombat).</p> <p>From code perspective difference is negligible, but run-time is significantly different. Module-oriented solution is certainly faster: less object creation, easier to optimize operations common for all wombats. </p> <p>Problems come when number of types and modules grow. Either you lose most of performance advantage because each module only supports several items, or modules' complexity grows to accomodate for slightly different items of one general type - say, fat and slim wombats. Or both.</p> <p>At least once I've seen it degrade into poor state when all WombatModule does is keep a collection of hidden Wombat objects and run their methods in loop.</p> <p>When performance is less of a problem than long-term development, can you identify any architectural reasons to use modules instead of per-item objects? May be there's another possibility I'm missing?</p>

So I wanted to present the question to the stackoverflow crowd ... what would be the best way to set up an automated build and deployment system using the following configuration:</p> <ul> <li>Visual Studio 2008</li> <li>Web Application Project</li> <li>CruiseControl.NET</li> </ul> <p>One of the first things I tried was to have CCnet automatically zip the output and copy it to the server, but then that requires manual work to unzip at the destination. However, if we try to copy all the files individually, then it could potentially take a long time if it's a large application (build server lives outside of the datacenter in our office ... I know).</p> <p>Also of particular interest is how we would support multiple environments as we have dev, qa, uat, and then of course prod.</p> <p><a href="http://blogs.iis.net/msdeploy/archive/2008/01/22/welcome-to-the-web-deployment-team-blog.aspx" rel="noreferrer">MSDeploy</a> seems really interesting, but unless I'm interpreting the literature incorrectly, doesn't help in the scenario of deploying from the output of a build server. If anything, it seems like it'll be useful in deploying one build across a build farm ... but even for deploying from one environment to another, one would have to manually change config settings and web service URLs, etc.</p>

4618766	1	Strategy to make pdf() in R use other devices <p>This is a multi-part question to SO folks before I engage more with core team. </p> <p><strong>Summary: On OS X, pdfs should be created using quartz, not postscript. Files are smaller, anti-aliased better, OS fonts including opentype are readily available, encoding is less painful, overall I think it’s a better device. On other platforms, it would be reasonable to use cairo, again a more modern pdf-writing device.</strong></p> <p>Consider the behavior of the png() device. Although it is allegedly slated to move out of x11.R, it handles c("cairo", "Xlib", "quartz") with a default (options("bitmapType")) set by zzz.R (quartz if capabilities("aqua"), cairo if available, Xlib otherwise). PDF needs to behave the same way, so that in Sweave (or babel or whatever) my pdf figures can be generated using the appropriate device. </p> <p>My <a href="https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14418" rel="nofollow">Sweave png patch</a> works because png() takes care of getting the device option. An earlier version of the patch (<a href="https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/attachment.cgi?id=1137&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">which I still use</a>) flips the device in Sweave, but I was smacked down for this and I know it’s sort of the wrong the place to do it.</p> <p><li>There’s some alias cairo_pdf() (also in x11.R) that probably should not be there, shouldn’t that be merged into a device-switching pdf() ?</li> <li>One approach is to add option "pdfType", which in turn I think should probably be more general – there is already a default device, it’s just that pdf() ignores it! I’m especially wary of introducing new global options because they are more likely to be rejected by core.</p>

However this can obviously mean that there are a lot of postbacks occuring when say, selecting options (which render differently when selected).</p> <p>In time, I will need to make this more Ajax-y and responsive, so I will need to change the event binding to call local Javascript.</p> <p>So, I was thinking I should be able to toggle the "mode" of the control, it can either use postback and handlle itself, or you can specify the Javascript function names to call instead of the doPostBack.</p> <ul> <li>What are your thoughts on this?</li> <li>Am I approaching the raising of the events from the control in the wrong way? (totally open to suggestions here!)</li> <li>How would you approach a similar problem? <hr></li> </ul> <h2>Edit - To Clarify</h2> <ul> <li>I am creating a custom rendered control (i.e. inherits from WebControl).</li> <li>We are not using existnig Web Controls since we want complete control over the rendered output.</li> <li>AFAIK the only way to get a server side event to occur from a custom rendered control is to call doPostBack from the rendered elements (please correct if wrong!).</li> <li>ASP.NET MVC is not an option.</li> </ul>
58940	0	Access to Result sets from within Stored procedures Transact-SQL SQL Server <p>I'm using SQL Server 2005, and I would like to know how to access different result sets from within transact-sql. The following stored procedure returns two result sets, how do I access them from, for example, another stored procedure?</p> <pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE getOrder (@orderId as numeric) AS BEGIN select order_address, order_number from order_table where order_id = @orderId select item, number_of_items, cost from order_line where order_id = @orderId END </code></pre> <p>I need to be able to iterate through both result sets individually.</p> <p>EDIT: Just to clarify the question, I want to test the stored procedures. I have a set of stored procedures which are used from a VB.NET client, which return multiple result sets. These are not going to be changed to a table valued function, I can't in fact change the procedures at all. Changing the procedure is not an option.</p> <p>The result sets returned by the procedures are not the same data types or number of columns.</p>

4682709	1	How to write an R function that evaluates an expression within a data-frame <p>Puzzle for the R cognoscenti: Say we have a data-frame:</p> <pre><code>df &lt;- data.frame( a = 1:5, b = 1:5 ) </code></pre> <p>I know we can do things like</p> <pre><code>with(df, a) </code></pre> <p>to get a vector of results. </p> <p>But how do I write a function that takes an expression (such as <code>a</code> or <code>a &gt; 3</code>) and does the same thing inside. I.e. I want to write a function <code>fn</code> that takes a data-frame and an expression as arguments and returns the result of evaluating the expression "within" the data-frame as an environment. </p> <p>Never mind that this sounds contrived (I could just use <code>with</code> as above), but this is just a simplified version of a more complex function I am writing. I tried several variants ( using <code>eval</code>, <code>with</code>, <code>envir</code>, <code>substitute</code>, <code>local</code>, etc) but none of them work. For example if I define <code>fn</code> like so:</p> <pre><code>fn &lt;- function(dat, expr) { eval(expr, envir = dat) } </code></pre> <p>I get this error:</p> <pre><code>&gt; fn( df, a ) Error in eval(expr, envir = dat) : object 'a' not found </code></pre> <p>Clearly I am missing something subtle about environments and evaluation. Is there a way to define such a function?</p>

4692231	1	R: passing expression to an inner function <p>Further delving into the mysteries of R evaluation...This is closely related to my previous question ( <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4682709/how-to-write-an-r-function-that-evaluates-an-expression-within-a-data-frame">How to write an R function that evaluates an expression within a data-frame</a> ). Let's say I want to write a function <code>topfn</code> that takes a data-frame and an expression involving column-names of that data-frame. I want to pass both these arguments on to another function <code>fn</code> that actually evaluates the expression within the "environment" of the data-frame. <em>And I want both <code>fn</code> and <code>topfn</code> to work correctly when passed a data-frame and an expression</em></p> <p>My first attempt, as suggested in the answer to the above question, is to define:</p> <pre><code> fn &lt;- function(dfr, expr) { mf &lt;- match.call() eval( mf$expr, envir = dfr ) } </code></pre> <p>And define <code>topfn</code> like this:</p> <pre><code>topfn &lt;- function(df, ex) { mf &lt;- match.call() fn(df, mf$ex) } </code></pre> <p>Now if I have a data-frame</p> <pre><code>df &lt;- data.frame( a = 1:5, b = 1:5 ) </code></pre> <p>the inner function <code>fn</code> works fine: </p> <pre><code>&gt; fn(df,a) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 </code></pre> <p>But the <code>topfn</code> does not work: </p> <pre><code>&gt; topfn(df,a) mf$ex </code></pre> <p>To fix this I first check the class of <code>topfn(df,a)</code>, </p> <pre><code>&gt; class(topfn(df,a)) [1] "call" </code></pre> <p>This gives me an idea for an ugly hack to re-define <code>fn</code> as follows:</p> <pre><code>fn &lt;- function(dfr, expr) { mf &lt;- match.call() res &lt;- eval(mf$expr, envir = dfr) if(class(res) == 'call') eval(expr, envir = dfr) else res } </code></pre> <p>And now both functions work:</p> <pre><code>&gt; fn(df,a) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 &gt; topfn(df,a) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 </code></pre> <p>As I said, this looks like an ugly hack. Is there a better way (or more standard idiom) to get these working? I've consulted Lumley's curiously-named Standard NonStandard Evaluation Rules document <a href="http://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf" rel="noreferrer">http://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf</a> but wasn't particularly enlightened after reading it.

The code, where functions will be replaced, is Video File Player and it already works with the regular hdd files. It is also needed, that Video Player still can play files from HDD, if the file in the VideoPlayer input is a regular hdd file.</p> <p>What is the best practice for such task?</p>
4750866	1	Aggregate() example in R <p>I was looking at the help page for the <code>aggregate</code> function in R. I had never used this convenience function but I have a process it should help me speed up. However, I've been totally unable to walk through the example and understand what is going on. </p> <p>One example is the following:</p> <pre><code>1&gt; aggregate(state.x77, list(Region = state.region), mean) Region Population Income Illiteracy Life Exp Murder HS Grad Frost Area 1 Northeast 5495 4570 1.000 71.26 4.722 53.97 132.78 18141 2 South 4208 4012 1.738 69.71 10.581 44.34 64.62 54605 3 North Central 4803 4611 0.700 71.77 5.275 54.52 138.83 62652 4 West 2915 4703 1.023 71.23 7.215 62.00 102.15 134463 </code></pre> <p>The output here is exactly what I would expect. So I try to understand what is going on. So I look at <code>state.x77</code></p> <pre><code>1&gt; head(state.x77) Population Income Illiteracy Life Exp Murder HS Grad Frost Area Alabama 3615 3624 2.1 69.05 15.1 41.3 20 50708 Alaska 365 6315 1.5 69.31 11.3 66.7 152 566432 Arizona 2212 4530 1.8 70.55 7.8 58.1 15 113417 Arkansas 2110 3378 1.9 70.66 10.1 39.9 65 51945 California 21198 5114 1.1 71.71 10.3 62.6 20 156361 Colorado 2541 4884 0.7 72.06 6.8 63.9 166 103766 </code></pre> <p>OK, that's odd to me. I would expect to see a column in state.x77 named <code>state.region</code> or something. So state.region must be its own object. So I do a str() on it:</p> <pre><code>1&gt; str(state.region) Factor w/ 4 levels "Northeast","South",..: 2 4 4 2 4 4 1 2 2 2 ... </code></pre> <p>It looks like state.region is just a factor. Somehow there HAS to be a connection between state.region and state.x77 in order for aggregate() to group state.x77 by state.region. But that connection is a mystery to me. Can you help me fill in my obvious misunderstandings?</p>

4761073	1	R: how to rbind two huge data-frames without running out of memory <p>I have two data-frames <code>df1</code> and <code>df2</code> that each have around 10 million rows and 4 columns. I read them into R using RODBC/sqlQuery with no problems, but when I try to <code>rbind</code> them, I get that most dreaded of R error messages: <code>cannot allocate memory</code>.

61085	0	SQLite/PHP read-only? <p>I've been trying to use SQLite with the PDO wrapper in PHP with mixed success. I can read from the database fine, but none of my updates are being committed to the database when I view the page in the browser. Curiously, running the script from my shell does update the database. I suspected file permissions as the culprit, but even with the database providing full access (chmod 777) the problem persists. Should I try changing the file owner? If so, what to?</p> <p>By the way, my machine is the standard Mac OS X Leopard install with PHP activated.</p> <p>@Tom Martin</p> <p>Thank you for your reply. I just ran your code and it looks like PHP runs as user _www. I then tried chowning the database to be owned by _www, but that didn't work either.</p> <p>I should also note that PDO's errorInfo function doesn't indicate an error took place. Could this be a setting with PDO somehow opening the database for read-only? I've heard that SQLite performs write locks on the entire file. Is it possible that the database is locked by something else preventing the write?</p> <p>I've decided to include the code in question.

61219	0	Debug.Assert vs. Specific Thrown Exceptions <p>I've just started skimming 'Debugging MS .Net 2.0 Applications' by John Robbins, and have become confused by his evangelism for Debug.Assert(...).</p> <p>He points out that well-implemented Asserts store the state, somewhat, of an error condition, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>Debug.Assert(i &gt; 3, "i &gt; 3", "This means I got a bad parameter"); </code></pre> <p>Now, personally, it seems crazy to me that he so loves restating his test without an actual sensible 'business logic' comment, perhaps "i &lt;= 3 must never happen because of the flobittyjam widgitification process".</p> <p>So, I think I get Asserts as a kind-of low-level "Let's protect my assumptions" kind of thing... assuming that one feels this is a test one only needs to do in debug - i.e. you are protecting yourself against colleague and future programmers, and hoping that they actually test things.</p> <p>But what I don't get is, he then goes on to say that you should use assertions in addition to normal error handling; now what I envisage is something like this:</p> <pre><code>Debug.Assert(i &gt; 3, "i must be greater than 3 because of the flibbity widgit status"); if (i &lt;= 3) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("i", "i must be &gt; 3 because... i=" + i.ToString()); } </code></pre> <p>What have I gained by the Debug.Assert repetition of the error condition test? I think I'd get it if we were talking about debug-only double-checking of a very important calculation...</p> <pre><code>double interestAmount = loan.GetInterest(); Debug.Assert(debugInterestDoubleCheck(loan) == interestAmount, "Mismatch on interest calc"); </code></pre> <p>...but I don't get it for parameter tests which are surely worth checking (in both DEBUG and Release builds)... or not. What am I missing?</p>

Why haven't I done that?" In particular, Scott talked about a website that placed a hidden link at the top of a web page that said "skip to main content". The link will only be visible to people using screen readers and it allows their screen reader to jump past menus and other secondary content. It's such an obvious improvement yet it's easy not to think of it.</p> <p>There is more to accessibility and the overall user experience than simply creating valid XHTML and calling it a day.</p> <p>What are some of your simple tricks for improving the user experience for the vision impaired?</p>
61401	0	Hidden Features of PHP? <p>I know this sounds like a point-whoring question but let me explain where I'm coming from.</p> <p>Out of college I got a job at a PHP shop. I worked there for a year and a half and thought that I had learned all there was to learn about programming.</p> <p>Then I got a job as a one-man internal development shop at a sizable corporation where all the work was in C#. In my commitment to the position I started reading a ton of blogs and books and quickly realized how wrong I was to think I knew everything. I learned about unit testing, dependency injection and decorator patterns, the design principle of loose coupling, the composition over inheritance debate, and so on and on and on - I am still very much absorbing it all. Needless to say my programming style has changed entirely in the last year.</p> <p>Now I find myself picking up a php project doing some coding for a friend's start-up and I feel completely constrained as opposed to programming in C#. It really bothers me that all variables at a class scope have to be referred to by appending '$this->' . It annoys me that none of the IDEs that I've tried have very good intellisense and that my SimpleTest unit tests methods have to start with the word 'test'. It drives me crazy that dynamic typing keeps me from specifying implicitly which parameter type a method expects, and that you have to write a switch statement to do method overloads. I can't stand that you can't have nested namespaces and have to use the :: operator to call the base class's constructor.</p> <p>Now I have no intention of starting a PHP vs C# debate, rather what I mean to say is that I'm sure there are some PHP features that I either don't know about or know about yet fail to use properly. I am set in my C# universe and having trouble seeing outside the glass bowl.</p> <p>So I'm asking, what are your favorite features of PHP? What are things you can do in it that you can't or are more difficult in the .Net languages?</p>
61421	0	How do I make a ListBox refresh its item text? <p>I'm making an example for someone who hasn't yet realized that controls like <code>ListBox</code> don't have to contain strings; he had been storing formatted strings and jumping through complicated parsing hoops to get the data back out of the <code>ListBox</code> and I'd like to show him there's a better way.</p> <p>I noticed that if I have an object stored in the <code>ListBox</code> then update a value that affects <code>ToString</code>, the <code>ListBox</code> does not update itself. I've tried calling <code>Refresh</code> and <code>Update</code> on the control, but neither works. Here's the code of the example I'm using, it requires you to drag a listbox and a button onto the form:</p> <pre><code>Public Class Form1 Protected Overrides Sub OnLoad(ByVal e As System.EventArgs) MyBase.OnLoad(e) For i As Integer = 1 To 3 Dim tempInfo As New NumberInfo() tempInfo.Count = i tempInfo.Number = i * 100 ListBox1.Items.Add(tempInfo) Next End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click For Each objItem As Object In ListBox1.Items Dim info As NumberInfo = DirectCast(objItem, NumberInfo) info.Count += 1 Next End Sub End Class Public Class NumberInfo Public Count As Integer Public Number As Integer Public Overrides Function ToString() As String Return String.Format("{0}, {1}", Count, Number) End Function End Class</code></pre> <p>I thought that perhaps the problem was using fields and tried implementing <em>INotifyPropertyChanged</em>, but this had no effect. (The reason I'm using fields is because it's an example and I don't feel like adding a few dozen lines that have nothing to do with the topic I'm demonstrating.)</p> <p>Honestly I've never tried updating items in place like this before; in the past I've always been adding/removing items, not editing them. So I've never noticed that I don't know how to make this work.</p> <p>So what am I missing?</p>
